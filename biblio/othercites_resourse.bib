abstract = {Genome instability triggers cellular senescence and is a common cause of cancer. The ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), due to their repetitive structure, form a fragile site with frequent rearrangements. To identify eukaryotic factors that connect reduced genome stability to senescence we screened 4,876 strains of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion library for aberrant rDNA and found 708 genes that contribute to its upkeep. 28 mutants caused abnormalities in non-rDNA chromosomes and among them 12 mutants have abnormalities both in rDNA and in non-rDNA chromosomes. Many mutated genes have not previously been implicated with genome maintenance nor their homologues with tumorigenesis in mammals. The link between rDNA state and senescence was broken after deletion of factors related with DNA polymerase ϵ. These mutations also suppressed the short lifespan phenotype of a sir2 mutant, suggesting a model in which molecular events at the heart of the replication fork induce abnormal rDNA recombination and are responsible for the emergence of an aging signal.},

abstract = {Chromosome instability is a key component of cancer progression and many heritable diseases. Understanding why some chromosomes are more unstable than others could provide insight into understanding genome integrity. Here we systematically investigate the spontaneous chromosome loss for all sixteen chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying chromosome instability. We observed that the stability of different chromosomes varied more than 100-fold. Consistent with previous studies on artificial chromosomes, chromosome loss frequency was negatively correlated to chromosome length in S. cerevisiae diploids, triploids and S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus hybrids. Chromosome III, an equivalent of sex chromosomes in budding yeast, was found to be the most unstable chromosome among all cases examined. Moreover, similar instability was observed in chromosome III of S. bayanus, a species that diverged from S. cerevisiae about 20 million years ago, suggesting that the instability is caused by a conserved mechanism. Chromosome III was found to have a highly relaxed spindle checkpoint response in the genome. Using a plasmid stability assay, we found that differences in the centromeric sequence may explain certain aspects of chromosome instability. Our results reveal that even under normal conditions, individual chromosomes in a genome are subject to different levels of pressure in chromosome loss (or gain).},

It enables one to carry out genome-wide screening for regions of genetic alterations, such as chromosome gains and losses, or localized amplifications and deletions. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm 'Cluster along chromosomes' (CLAC) for the analysis of array CGH data. CLAC builds hierarchical clustering-style trees along each chromosome arm (or chromosome), and then selects the 'interesting' clusters by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a certain level. In addition, it provides a consensus summary across a set of arrays, as well as an estimate of the corresponding FDR. We illustrate the method using an application of CLAC on a lung cancer microarray CGH data set as well as a BAC array CGH data set of aneuploid cell strains.},

abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two alternative mating types designated MATa and MAT$\alpha$. These are distinguished by about 700 bp of unique sequences, Ya or Y$\alpha$, including divergent promoter sequences and part of the open reading frames of genes that regulate mating phenotype. Homothallic budding yeast, carrying an active HO endonuclease gene, HO, can switch mating type through a recombination process known as gene conversion, in which a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) created immediately adjacent to the Y region results in replacement of the Y sequences with a copy of the opposite mating type information, which is harbored in one of two heterochromatic donor loci, HML$\alpha$ or HMRa. HO gene expression is tightly regulated to ensure that only half of the cells in a lineage switch to the opposite MAT allele, thus promoting conjugation and diploid formation. Study of the silencing of these loci has provided a great deal of information about the role of the Sir2 histone deacetylase and its associated Sir3 and Sir4 proteins in creating heterochromatic regions. MAT switching has been examined in great detail to learn about the steps in homologous recombination. MAT switching is remarkably directional, with MATa recombining preferentially with HML$\alpha$ and MAT$\alpha$ using HMRa. Donor preference is controlled by a cis-acting recombination enhancer located near HML. RE is turned off in MAT$\alpha$ cells but in MATa binds multiple copies of the Fkh1 transcription factor whose forkhead-associated phosphothreonine binding domain localizes at the DSB, bringing HML into conjunction with MATa.},

abstract = {Long gaps between active replication origins probably occur frequently during chromosome replication, but little is known about how cells cope with them. To address this issue, we deleted replication origins from S. cerevisiae chromosome III to create chromosomes with long interorigin gaps and identified mutations that destabilize them [originless fragment maintenance (Ofm) mutations]. ofm6-1 is an allele of HST3, a sirtuin that deacetylates histone H3K56Ac. Hst3p and Hst4p are closely related, but hst4$\Delta$ does not cause an Ofm phenotype. Expressing HST4 under the control of the HST3 promoter suppressed the Ofm phenotype of hst3$\Delta$, indicating Hst4p, when expressed at the appropriate levels and/or at the correct time, can fully substitute for Hst3p in maintenance of ORI$\Delta$ chromosomes. H3K56Ac is the Hst3p substrate critical for chromosome maintenance. H3K56Ac-containing nucleosomes are preferentially assembled into chromatin behind replication forks. Deletion of the H3K56 acetylase and downstream chromatin assembly factors suppressed the Ofm phenotype of hst3, indicating that persistence of H3K56Ac-containing chromatin is deleterious for the maintenance of ORI$\Delta$ chromosomes, and experiments with synchronous cultures showed that it is replication of H3K56Ac-containing chromatin that causes chromosome loss. This work shows that while normal chromosomes can tolerate hyperacetylation of H3K56Ac, deacetylation of histone H3K56Ac by Hst3p is required for stable maintenance of a chromosome with a long interorigin gap. The Ofm phenotype is the first report of a chromosome instability phenotype of an hst3 single mutant.},

@article{McKinney2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efficient mechanisms for rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are vital because misrepair of such lesions leads to mutation, aneuploidy and loss of cell viability. DSB repair is mediated by proteins acting in two major pathways, called homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining. Repair efficiency is also modulated by other processes such as sister chromatid cohesion, nucleosome remodeling and DNA damage checkpoints. The total number of genes influencing DSB repair efficiency is unknown.

RESULTS: To identify new yeast genes affecting DSB repair, genes linked to gamma radiation resistance in previous genome-wide surveys were tested for their impact on repair of site-specific DSBs generated by in vivo expression of EcoRI endonuclease. Eight members of the RAD52 group of DNA repair genes (RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, MRE11 and XRS2) and 73 additional genes were found to be required for efficient repair of EcoRI-induced DSBs in screens utilizing both MATa and MAT$\alpha$ deletion strain libraries. Most mutants were also sensitive to the clastogenic chemicals MMS and bleomycin. Several of the non-RAD52 group genes have previously been linked to DNA repair and over half of the genes affect nuclear processes. Many proteins encoded by the protective genes have previously been shown to associate physically with each other and with known DNA repair proteins in high-throughput proteomics studies. A majority of the proteins (64{\%}) share sequence similarity with human proteins, suggesting that they serve similar functions.

CONCLUSIONS: We have used a genetic screening approach to detect new genes required for efficient repair of DSBs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The findings have spotlighted new genes that are critical for maintenance of genome integrity and are therefore of greatest concern for their potential impact when the corresponding gene orthologs and homologs are inactivated or polymorphic in human cells.},

Here we report a green fluorescent protein-based quantitative chromosome transmission fidelity (qCTF) assay in budding yeast that allows sensitive and quantitative detection of CIN and can be easily adapted to high-throughput analysis. Using the qCTF assay, we performed genome-wide quantitative profiling of genes that affect CIN in a dosage-dependent manner and identified genes that elevate CIN when either increased (icCIN) or decreased in copy number (dcCIN). Unexpectedly, qCTF screening also revealed genes whose change in copy number quantitatively suppress CIN, suggesting that the basal error rate of the wild-type genome is not minimized, but rather, may have evolved toward an optimal level that balances both stability and low-level karyotype variation for evolutionary adaptation.},

Eighty-five percent of the mutations are recessive and 15{\%} are partially dominant. Complementation analysis between MATa and MAT alpha isolates identifies 11 chromosome transmission fidelity (CTF) complementation groups, the largest of which is identical to CHL1. For 49 independent mutations, no corresponding allele has been recovered in the opposite mating type. The initial screen monitored the stability of a centromere-linked color marker on a nonessential yeast chromosome fragment; the mitotic inheritance of natural yeast chromosome III is also affected by the ctf mutations. Of the 136 isolates identified, seven were inviable at 37 degrees and five were inviable at 11 degrees. In all cases tested, these temperature conditional lethalities cosegregated with the chromosome instability phenotype. Five additional complementation groups (ctf12 through ctf16) have been defined by complementation analysis of the mutations causing inviability at 37 degrees. Twenty-three of the 136 isolates exhibited growth defects at concentrations of benomyl permissive for the parent strain, and nine appeared to be tolerant of inhibitory levels of benomyl. All of the mutant strains showed normal sensitivity to ultraviolet and gamma-irradiation. Further characterization of these mutant strains will describe the functions of gene products crucial to the successful execution of processes required for aspects of the chromosome cycle that are important for chromosome transmission fidelity in mitosis.

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation requires the execution and coordination of many processes during mitosis, including DNA replication, sister chromatid cohesion, and attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules via the kinetochore complex. Additional pathways are likely involved because faithful chromosome segregation also requires proteins that are not physically associated with the chromosome. Using kinetochore mutants as a starting point, we have identified genes with roles in chromosome stability by performing genome-wide screens employing synthetic genetic array methodology. Two genetic approaches (a series of synthetic lethal and synthetic dosage lethal screens) isolated 211 nonessential deletion mutants that were unable to tolerate defects in kinetochore function. Although synthetic lethality and synthetic dosage lethality are thought to be based upon similar genetic principles, we found that the majority of interactions associated with these two screens were nonoverlapping. To functionally characterize genes isolated in our screens, a secondary screen was performed to assess defects in chromosome segregation. Genes identified in the secondary screen were enriched for genes with known roles in chromosome segregation. We also uncovered genes with diverse functions, such as RCS1, which encodes an iron transcription factor. RCS1 was one of a small group of genes identified in all three screens, and we used genetic and cell biological assays to confirm that it is required for chromosome stability. Our study shows that systematic genetic screens are a powerful means to discover roles for uncharacterized genes and genes with alternative functions in chromosome maintenance that may not be discovered by using proteomics approaches.},

Misfolded proteins retained in the ER are subjected to proteasome-dependent degradation in the cytosol when they cannot achieve correct folding and/or assembly within an appropriate time window. Although specific mannose trimming of the protein-bound oligosaccharide is essential for the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins, the precise mechanism for this recognition remains obscure. Here we report a new alpha-mannosidase-like protein, Mnl1p (mannosidase-like protein), in the yeast ER. Mnl1p is unlikely to exhibit alpha1,2-mannosidase activity, because it lacks cysteine residues that are essential for alpha1,2-mannosidase. However deletion of the MNL1 gene causes retardation of the degradation of misfolded carboxypeptidase Y, but not of the unglycosylated mutant form of the yeast alpha-mating pheromone. Possible roles of Mnl1p in the degradation and in the ER-retention of misfolded glycoproteins are discussed.},

abstract = {Proper histone levels are critical for transcription, chromosome segregation, and other chromatin-mediated processes(1-7). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histones H2A and H2B are encoded by two gene pairs, named HTA1-HTB1 and HTA2-HTB2 (ref. 8). Previous studies have demonstrated that when HTA2-HTB2 is deleted, HTA1-HTB1 dosage compensates at the transcriptional level(4,9). Here we show that a different mechanism of dosage compensation, at the level of gene copy number, can occur when HTA1-HTB1 is deleted. In this case, HTA2-HTB2 amplifies via creation of a new, small, circular chromosome. This duplication, which contains 39 kb of chromosome II, includes HTA2-HTB2, the histone H3-H4 locus HHT1-HHF1, a centromere and origins of replication. Formation of the new chromosome occurs by recombination between two Ty1 retrotransposon elements that flank this region. Following meiosis, recombination between these two particular Ty1 elements occurs at a greatly elevated level in hta1-htb1Delta mutants, suggesting that a decreased level of histones H2A and H2B specifically stimulates this amplification of histone genes. Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which histone gene dosage is controlled to maintain genomic integrity.},

abstract = {The concept of a prion as an infectious self-propagating protein isoform was initially proposed to explain certain mammalian diseases. It is now clear that yeast also has heritable elements transmitted via protein. Indeed, the "protein only" model of prion transmission was first proven using a yeast prion. Typically, known prions are ordered cross-$\beta$ aggregates (amyloids). Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of recognized prions in yeast. Yeast continues to lead the way in understanding cellular control of prion propagation, prion structure, mechanisms of de novo prion formation, specificity of prion transmission, and the biological roles of prions. This review summarizes what has been learned from yeast prions.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy is linked to myriad diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at >30{\%} of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations-but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.},

While a better understanding of modifier loci could lead to treatments for Mendelian diseases, the rarity of individuals harboring both a disease-causing allele and a modifying genotype hinders their study in human populations. We examined the genetic architecture of monogenic trait modifiers using a well-characterized yeast model of the human Mendelian disease classic galactosemia. Yeast strains with loss-of-function mutations in the yeast ortholog (GAL7) of the human disease gene (GALT) fail to grow in the presence of even small amounts of galactose due to accumulation of the same toxic intermediates that poison human cells. To isolate and individually genotype large numbers of the very rare (∼0.1{\%}) galactose-tolerant recombinant progeny from a cross between two gal7$\Delta$ parents, we developed a new method, called "FACS-QTL." FACS-QTL improves upon the currently used approaches of bulk segregant analysis and extreme QTL mapping by requiring less genome engineering and strain manipulation as well as maintaining individual genotype information. Our results identified multiple distinct solutions by which the monogenic trait could be suppressed, including genetic and nongenetic mechanisms as well as frequent aneuploidy.

abstract = {The SUP35 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the translation termination factor eRF3. Mutations in this gene lead to the suppression of nonsense mutations and a number of other pleiotropic phenotypes, one of which is impaired chromosome segregation during cell division. Similar effects result from replacing the S. cerevisiae SUP35 gene with its orthologues. A number of genetic and epigenetic changes that occur in the sup35 background result in partial compensation for this suppressor effect. In this study we showed that in S. cerevisiae strains in which the SUP35 orthologue from the yeast Pichia methanolica replaces the S. cerevisiae SUP35 gene, chromosome VIII disomy results in decreased efficiency of nonsense suppression. This antisuppressor effect is not associated with decreased stop codon read-through. We identified SBP1, a gene that localizes to chromosome VIII, as a dosage-dependent antisuppressor that strongly contributes to the overall antisuppressor effect of chromosome VIII disomy. Disomy of chromosome VIII also leads to a change in the yeast strains' tolerance of a number of transition metal salts.},

abstract = {Programmed stop codon readthrough is a post-transcription regulatory mechanism specifically increasing proteome diversity by creating a pool of C-terminally extended proteins. During this process, the stop codon is decoded as a sense codon by a near-cognate tRNA, which programs the ribosome to continue elongation. The efficiency of competition for the stop codon between release factors (eRFs) and near-cognate tRNAs is largely dependent on its nucleotide context; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is unknown. Here, we show that it is the translation initiation (not termination) factor, namely eIF3, which critically promotes programmed readthrough on all three stop codons. In order to do so, eIF3 must associate with pre-termination complexes where it interferes with the eRF1 decoding of the third/wobble position of the stop codon set in the unfavorable termination context, thus allowing incorporation of near-cognate tRNAs with a mismatch at the same position. We clearly demonstrate that efficient readthrough is enabled by near-cognate tRNAs with a mismatch only at the third/wobble position. Importantly, the eIF3 role in programmed readthrough is conserved between yeast and humans.},

abstract = {Gain or loss of chromosomes resulting in aneuploidy can be important factors in cancer and adaptive evolution. Although chromosome gain is a frequent event in eukaryotes, there is limited information on its genetic control. Here we measured the rates of chromosome gain in wild-type yeast and sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) compromised strains. SCC tethers the newly replicated chromatids until anaphase via the cohesin complex. Chromosome gain was measured by selecting and characterizing copper-resistant colonies that emerged due to increased copies of the metallothionein gene CUP1. Although all defective SCC diploid strains exhibited increased rates of chromosome gain, there were 15-fold differences between them. Of all mutants examined, a hypomorphic mutation at the cohesin complex caused the highest rate of chromosome gain while disruption of WPL1, an important regulator of SCC and chromosome condensation, resulted in the smallest increase in chromosome gain. In addition to defects in SCC, yeast cell type contributed significantly to chromosome gain, with the greatest rates observed for homozygous mating-type diploids, followed by heterozygous mating type, and smallest in haploids. In fact, wpl1-deficient haploids did not show any difference in chromosome gain rates compared to wild-type haploids. Genomic analysis of copper-resistant colonies revealed that the "driver" chromosome for which selection was applied could be amplified to over five copies per diploid cell. In addition, an increase in the expected driver chromosome was often accompanied by a gain of a small number of other chromosomes. We suggest that while chromosome gain due to SCC malfunction can have negative effects through gene imbalance, it could also facilitate opportunities for adaptive changes. In multicellular organisms, both factors could lead to somatic diseases including cancer.},

abstract = {Aneuploid generation and stability are biologically important. In the present study, we investigated fission yeast aneuploids, focusing on the process through which aneuploidy is resolved into stable euploidy. The viability and growth patterns of aneuploid spores were greatly influenced by culture conditions, including nutrition and temperature. Germ tube formation and DNA synthesis in a major portion of aneuploids were greatly delayed or arrested. Observation of individual spores and their growth profiles revealed that a certain type(s) of aneuploid resolved its aneuploidy into normal euploids through anomalous cell divisions, which in many cases produced dead cells. Another type of aneuploid, disomy of chromosome 3, the only maintainable aneuploid between n and 2n, showed a peculiar cell division arrest phenotype under a certain growth condition. Microcolonies that formed from this type of aneuploid often contained a population of cells that became incompetent for cell division. This cell division arrest was not due to a nutritional limitation. During this peculiar process of colony formation, stable haploids or diploids were frequently produced. All other types of aneuploids are usually inviable, at least under our experimental conditions. To examine the aneuploid issue more systematically, we constructed a system to select for disomy of chromosome 1 or 2 using intragenic complementation of ade6-M210 and -M216 alleles. This genetic selection system revealed that fission yeast aneuploids can be stabilized through structural chromosome changes, including partial duplication and circular mini-chromosomes.},

abstract = {Whether in natural populations or between two unrelated members of a species, most phenotypic variation is quantitative. To analyze such quantitative traits, one must first map the underlying quantitative trait loci. Next, and far more difficult, one must identify the quantitative trait genes (QTGs), characterize QTG interactions, and identify the phenotypically relevant polymorphisms to determine how QTGs contribute to phenotype. In this work, we analyzed three Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-temperature growth (Htg) QTGs (MKT1, END3, and RHO2). We observed a high level of genetic interactions among QTGs and strain background. Interestingly, while the MKT1 and END3 coding polymorphisms contribute to phenotype, it is the RHO2 3'UTR polymorphisms that are phenotypically relevant. Reciprocal hemizygosity analysis of the Htg QTGs in hybrids between S288c and ten unrelated S. cerevisiae strains reveals that the contributions of the Htg QTGs are not conserved in nine other hybrids, which has implications for QTG identification by marker-trait association. Our findings demonstrate the variety and complexity of QTG contributions to phenotype, the impact of genetic background, and the value of quantitative genetic studies in S. cerevisiae.},

In the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a variety of low-order amplifications (segmental duplications) were observed after adaptation to limiting environmental conditions or recovery from gene dosage imbalance, and interpreted in terms of replication-based mechanisms associated or not with homologous recombination. Here we show the emergence of novel high-order amplification structures, with corresponding overexpression of embedded genes, during evolution under favourable growth conditions of severely unfit yeast cells bearing genetically disabled genomes. Such events form massively extended chromosomes, which we propose to call macrotene, whose characteristics suggest the products of intrachromosomal rolling-circle type of replication structures, probably initiated by increased accidental template switches under important cellular stress conditions.},

abstract = {The genome sequences of more than 100 strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been published. Unfortunately, most of these genome assemblies contain dozens to hundreds of gaps at repetitive sequences, including transposable elements, tRNAs, and subtelomeric regions, which is where novel genes generally reside. Relatively few strains have been chosen for genome sequencing based on their biofuel production potential, leaving an additional knowledge gap. Here we describe the nearly complete genome sequence of GLBRCY22-3 (Y22-3), a strain of S. cerevisiae derived from the stress-tolerant wild strain NRRL YB-210 and subsequently engineered for xylose metabolism. After benchmarking several genome assembly approaches, we developed a pipeline to integrate Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Illumina sequencing data and achieved one of the highest quality genome assemblies for any S. cerevisiae strain. Specifically, the contig N50 is 693 kbp, and the sequences of most chromosomes, the mitochondrial genome, and 2-micron plasmid are complete. Our annotation predicts 92 genes that are not present in the reference genome of the laboratory strain S288c, over 70{\%} of which were expressed. We predicted functions for 43 of these genes, 28 of which were previously uncharacterized and unnamed. Remarkably, many of these genes are predicted to be involved in stress tolerance and carbon metabolism and are shared with a Brazilian bioethanol production strain, even though the strains differ dramatically at most genetic loci. The Y22-3 genome sequence provides an exceptionally high-quality resource for basic and applied research in bioenergy and genetics.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination is an important mechanism for the repair of DNA damage in mitotically dividing cells. Mitotic crossovers between homologues with heterozygous alleles can produce two homozygous daughter cells (loss of heterozygosity), whereas crossovers between repeated genes on non-homologous chromosomes can result in translocations. Using a genetic system that allows selection of daughter cells that contain the reciprocal products of mitotic crossing over, we mapped crossovers and gene conversion events at a resolution of about 4 kb in a 120-kb region of chromosome V of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene conversion tracts associated with mitotic crossovers are much longer (averaging about 12 kb) than the conversion tracts associated with meiotic recombination and are non-randomly distributed along the chromosome. In addition, about 40{\%} of the conversion events have patterns of marker segregation that are most simply explained as reflecting the repair of a chromosome that was broken in G1 of the cell cycle.},

abstract = {The increasing ability to sequence and compare multiple individual genomes within a species has highlighted the fact that copy-number variation (CNV) is a substantial and underappreciated source of genetic diversity. Chromosome-scale mutations occur at rates orders of magnitude higher than base substitutions, yet our understanding of the mechanisms leading to CNVs has been lagging. We examined CNV in a region of chromosome 5 (chr5) in haploid and diploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We optimized a CNV detection assay based on a reporter cassette containing the SFA1 and CUP1 genes that confer gene dosage-dependent tolerance to formaldehyde and copper, respectively. This optimized reporter allowed the selection of low-order gene amplification events, going from one copy to two copies in haploids and from two to three copies in diploids. In haploid strains, most events involved tandem segmental duplications mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination between flanking direct repeats, primarily Ty1 elements. In diploids, most events involved the formation of a recurrent nonreciprocal translocation between a chr5 Ty1 element and another Ty1 repeat on chr13. In addition to amplification events, a subset of clones displaying elevated resistance to formaldehyde had point mutations within the SFA1 coding sequence. These mutations were all dominant and are proposed to result in hyperactive forms of the formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme.},

abstract = {The rapamycin-sensitive and endomembrane-associated TORC1 pathway controls cell growth in response to nutrients in eukaryotes. Mutations in class C Vps (Vps-C) complexes are synthetically lethal with tor1 mutations and confer rapamycin hypersensitivity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting a role for these complexes in TORC1 signaling. Vps-C complexes are required for vesicular trafficking and fusion and comprise four distinct complexes: HOPS and CORVET and their minor intermediaries (i)-CORVET and i-HOPS. We show that at least one Vps-C complex is required to promote TORC1 activity, with the HOPS complex having the greatest input. The vps-c mutants fail to recover from rapamycin-induced growth arrest and show low levels of TORC1 activity. TORC1 promotes cell growth via Sch9, a p70(S6) kinase ortholog. Constitutively active SCH9 or hyperactive TOR1 alleles restored rapamycin recovery and TORC1 activity of vps-c mutants, supporting a role for the Vps-C complexes upstream of TORC1. The EGO GTPase complex Exit from G0 Complex (EGOC) and its homologous Rag-GTPase complex convey amino acid signals to TORC1 in yeast and mammals, respectively. Expression of the activated EGOC GTPase subunits Gtr1(GTP) and Gtr2(GDP) partially suppressed vps-c mutant rapamycin recovery defects, and this suppression was enhanced by increased amino acid concentrations. Moreover, vps-c mutations disrupted EGOC-TORC1 interactions. TORC1 defects were more severe for vps-c mutants than those observed in EGOC mutants. Taken together, our results support a model in which distinct endolysosomal trafficking Vps-C complexes promote rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 activity via multiple inputs, one of which involves maintenance of amino acid homeostasis that is sensed and transmitted to TORC1 via interactions with EGOC.},

Small pieces of cardiac muscle were incubated for 2-3 weeks at 4°C in Ca²⁺-depleting solution before their homogenization to decrease activity of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases. Then the muscle was homogenized, and titin was isolated by the method of Soteriou, A., et al. (1993) J. Cell Sci., 14, 119-123. In control experiments, titin was isolated from cardiac muscle without its preincubation in Ca²⁺-depleting solution. Sometimes control titin preparations contained only T2-fragment, but generally they contained {\~{}}5-20{\%} N2B-isoform of titin along with its T2-fragment. Preparations of titin obtained from rabbit cardiac muscle by our method contained {\~{}}30-50{\%} of N2BA- and N2B-titin isoforms along with its T2-fragment. The content of $\alpha$-structures in titin isolated by our method was increased. Actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro increased in the presence of titin preparations containing more intact molecules. This result confirms the significant role of titin in the regulation of actin-myosin interaction in muscles. The method used by us to preserve titin might be used for isolation of other proteins that are substrates of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle and modulating gene expression to ensure efficient DNA repair. The human ATR kinase and its homolog in yeast, MEC1, play central roles in transducing the damage signal. To characterize the role of the Mec1 pathway in modulating the cellular response to DNA damage, we used DNA microarrays to observe genomic expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae responding to two different DNA-damaging agents. We compared the genome-wide expression patterns of wild-type cells and mutants defective in Mec1 signaling, including mec1, dun1, and crt1 mutants, under normal growth conditions and in response to the methylating-agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and ionizing radiation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant cells responding to these DNA-damaging agents, and identify specific features of the gene expression responses that are dependent on the Mec1 pathway. Among the hundreds of genes whose expression was affected by Mec1p, one set of genes appears to represent an MEC1-dependent expression signature of DNA damage. Other aspects of the genomic responses were independent of Mec1p, and likely independent of DNA damage, suggesting the pleiotropic effects of MMS and ionizing radiation. The complete data set as well as supplemental materials is available at http://www-genome.stanford.edu/mec1.},

abstract = {Although transcription factors are prevalent among yeast prion proteins, the role of prion-mediated transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that the yeast prion [SWI(+)] abolishes flocculin (FLO) gene expression and results in a complete loss of multicellularity. Further investigation demonstrates that besides Swi1, multiple other proteins essential for FLO expression, including Mss11, Sap30, and Msn1 also undergo conformational changes and become inactivated in [SWI(+)] cells. Moreover, the asparagine-rich region of Mss11 can exist as prion-like aggregates specifically in [SWI(+)] cells, which are SDS resistant, heritable, and curable, but become metastable after separation from [SWI(+)]. Our findings thus reveal a prion-mediated mechanism through which multiple regulators in a biological pathway can be inactivated. In combination with the partial loss-of-function phenotypes of [SWI(+)] cells on non-glucose sugar utilization, our data therefore demonstrate that a prion can influence distinct traits differently through multi-level regulations, providing insights into the biological roles of prions.},

abstract = {The MAD2-dependent spindle checkpoint blocks anaphase until all chromosomes have achieved successful bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. The DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoints block anaphase in response to DNA lesions that may include single-stranded DNA and stalled replication forks. Many of the same conditions that activate the DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoints also activated the spindle checkpoint. The mad2{\{}Delta{\}} mutation partially relieved the arrest responses of cells to mutations affecting the replication proteins Mcm3p and Pol1p. Thus a previously unrecognized aspect of spindle checkpoint function may be to protect cells from defects in DNA replication. Furthermore, in cells lacking either the DNA damage or the DNA replication checkpoints, the spindle checkpoint contributed to the arrest responses of cells to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate, the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, and mutations affecting Mcm2p and Orc2p. Thus the spindle checkpoint was sensitive to a wider range of chromosomal perturbations than previously recognized. Finally, the DNA replication checkpoint did not contribute to the arrests of cells in response to mutations affecting ORC, Mcm proteins, or DNA polymerase {\{}delta{\}}. Thus the specificity of this checkpoint may be more limited than previously recognized.

abstract = {The human ATM and ATR proteins participate in the DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoint pathways and are critical to maintaining genome stability. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs of ATM and ATR are Tel1p and Mec1p, respectively. Haploid tel1 mec1 strains have very short telomeres and very high rates of chromosomal aberrations. Here, we examine genetic stability in tel1 mec1 diploid cells. In the absence of induced DNA damage, these yeast strains had very high frequencies of aneuploidy (both trisomy and monosomy) in addition to elevated rates of chromosome rearrangements. Although we found the aneuploidy in the tel1 mec1 diploids mimicked that observed in bub1 diploids, the tel1 mec1 diploids had a functional spindle assembly checkpoint. Restoration of wild-type telomere lengths in the tel1 mec1 strain substantially reduced the rate of chromosome rearrangements but had no effect on the frequency of aneuploidy.},

abstract = {Population adaptation to strong selection can occur through the sequential or parallel accumulation of competing beneficial mutations. The dynamics, diversity, and rate of fixation of beneficial mutations within and between populations are still poorly understood. To study how the mutational landscape varies across populations during adaptation, we performed experimental evolution on seven parallel populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae continuously cultured in limiting sulfate medium. By combining quantitative polymerase chain reaction, array comparative genomic hybridization, restriction digestion and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis, and whole-genome sequencing, we followed the trajectory of evolution to determine the identity and fate of beneficial mutations. During a period of 200 generations, the yeast populations displayed parallel evolutionary dynamics that were driven by the coexistence of independent beneficial mutations. Selective amplifications rapidly evolved under this selection pressure, in particular common inverted amplifications containing the sulfate transporter gene SUL1. Compared with single clones, detailed analysis of the populations uncovers a greater complexity whereby multiple subpopulations arise and compete despite a strong selection. The most common evolutionary adaptation to strong selection in these populations grown in sulfate limitation is determined by clonal interference, with adaptive variants both persisting and replacing one another.},

abstract = {An effective response to DNA damaging agents involves modulating numerous facets of cellular homeostasis in addition to DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoint pathways. Fluorescence microscopy-based imaging offers the opportunity to simultaneously interrogate changes in both protein level and subcellular localization in response to DNA damaging agents at the single-cell level. We report here results from screening the yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-fusion library to investigate global cellular protein reorganization on exposure to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Broad groups of induced, repressed, nucleus- and cytoplasm-enriched proteins were identified. Gene Ontology and interactome analyses revealed the underlying cellular processes. Transcription factor (TF) analysis identified principal regulators of the response, and targets of all major stress-responsive TFs were enriched amongst the induced proteins. An unexpected partitioning of biological function according to the number of TFs targeting individual genes was revealed. Finally, differential modulation of ribosomal proteins depending on methyl methanesulfonate dose was shown to correlate with cell growth and with the translocation of the Sfp1 TF. We conclude that cellular responses can navigate different routes according to the extent of damage, relying on both expression and localization changes of specific proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evolution of microbial populations provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary adaptation in response to controlled selective pressures. However, until recently it has been difficult to identify the precise genetic changes underlying adaptation at a genome-wide scale. New DNA sequencing technologies now allow the genome of parental and evolved strains of microorganisms to be rapidly determined.

RESULTS: We sequenced >93.5{\%} of the genome of a laboratory-evolved strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its ancestor at >28x depth. Both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number amplifications were found, with specific gains over array-based methodologies previously used to analyze these genomes. Applying a segmentation algorithm to quantify structural changes, we determined the approximate genomic boundaries of a 5x gene amplification. These boundaries guided the recovery of breakpoint sequences, which provide insights into the nature of a complex genomic rearrangement.

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that whole-genome sequencing can provide a rapid approach to uncover the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations, with further applications in the study of laboratory selections and mutagenesis screens. In addition, we show how single-end, short read sequencing data can provide detailed information about structural rearrangements, and generate predictions about the genomic features and processes that underlie genome plasticity.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy is a hallmark of tumor cells, and yet the precise relationship between aneuploidy and a cell's proliferative ability, or cellular fitness, has remained elusive. In this study, we have combined a detailed analysis of aneuploid clones isolated from laboratory-evolved populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a systematic, genome-wide screen for the fitness effects of telomeric amplifications to address the relationship between aneuploidy and cellular fitness. We found that aneuploid clones rise to high population frequencies in nutrient-limited evolution experiments and show increased fitness relative to wild type. Direct competition experiments confirmed that three out of four aneuploid events isolated from evolved populations were themselves sufficient to improve fitness. To expand the scope beyond this small number of exemplars, we created a genome-wide collection of >1,800 diploid yeast strains, each containing a different telomeric amplicon (Tamp), ranging in size from 0.4 to 1,000 kb. Using pooled competition experiments in nutrient-limited chemostats followed by high-throughput sequencing of strain-identifying barcodes, we determined the fitness effects of these >1,800 Tamps under three different conditions. Our data revealed that the fitness landscape explored by telomeric amplifications is much broader than that explored by single-gene amplifications. As also observed in the evolved clones, we found the fitness effects of most Tamps to be condition specific, with a minority showing common effects in all three conditions. By integrating our data with previous work that examined the fitness effects of single-gene amplifications genome-wide, we found that a small number of genes within each Tamp are centrally responsible for each Tamp's fitness effects. Our genome-wide Tamp screen confirmed that telomeric amplifications identified in laboratory-evolved populations generally increased fitness. Our results show that Tamps are mutations that produce large, typically condition-dependent changes in fitness that are important drivers of increased fitness in asexually evolving populations.},

However, this inhibition is relived and SCC is established as a response to DNA damage, a process known as Damage Induced Cohesion (DIC). In yeast, Chk1, which is a kinase that functions in DNA damage signal transduction, is considered an activator of SCC through DIC. Nonetheless, here we show that, unlike SCC mutations, loss of CHK1 did not increase spontaneous or damage-induced allelic recombination or aneuploidy. We suggest that Chk1 has a redundant role in the control of DIC or that DIC is redundant for maintaining genome stability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth rate is determined not only by extracellular cues such as nutrient availability but also by intracellular processes. Changes in cell morphology in budding yeast, mediated by polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, have been shown to reduce cell growth.

RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that polarization of the actin cytoskeleton inhibits the highly conserved Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) pathway. This downregulation is suppressed by inactivation of the TORC1 pathway regulatory Iml1 complex, which also regulates TORC1 during nitrogen starvation. We further demonstrate that attenuation of growth is important for cell recovery after conditions of prolonged polarized growth.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that extended periods of polarized growth inhibit protein synthesis, mass accumulation, and the increase in cell size at least in part through inhibiting the TORC1 pathway. We speculate that this mechanism serves to coordinate the ability of cells to increase in size with their biosynthetic capacity.},

abstract = {DNA damage response and repair proteins are centrally involved in genome maintenance pathways. Yet, little is known about their functional role under non-DNA damage-inducing conditions. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16{\%} of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of ∼2{\%} of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae can import iron through a high-affinity system consisting of the Ftr1/Fet3-mediated reductive pathway and the siderophore-mediated non-reductive one. Expression of components of the high-affinity system is controlled by the Aft1 transcriptional factor. In this study we show that, upon oxidative stress, Aft1 is transitorily internalized into the nucleus, followed by transcription activation of components of its regulon. In these conditions, the mRNA levels of the genes of the non-reductive pathway become increased, while those of FTR1 and FET3 remain low because of destabilization of the mRNAs. Consequently, the respective protein levels also remain low. Such mRNA destabilization is mediated by the general 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway and is independent of the RNA binding protein Cth2. Yeast cells are hypersensitive to peroxides in growth conditions where only the high-affinity reductive pathway is functional for iron assimilation. On the contrary, peroxide does not affect growth when iron uptake occurs exclusively through the non-reductive pathway. This reinforces the idea that upon oxidative stress S. cerevisiae cells redirect iron assimilation through the non-reductive pathway to minimize oxidative damage by the ferrous ions, which are formed during iron import through the Ftr1/Fet3 complexes.},

However, the mechanism by which introns regulate the expression of RPGs and their impact on the synthesis of ribosomal proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that introns determine the ratio of ribosomal protein isoforms through asymmetric paralog-specific regulation of splicing. Exchanging the introns and 3' untranslated regions of the duplicated RPS9 genes altered the splicing efficiency and changed the ratio of the ribosomal protein isoforms. Mutational analysis of the RPS9 genes indicated that splicing is regulated by variations in the intron structure and the 3' untranslated region. Together these data suggest that preferential splicing of duplicated RPGs provides a means for adjusting the ratio of different ribosomal protein isoforms, while maintaining the overall expression level of each ribosomal protein.},

We therefore monitored mRNA expression genome-wide, for individual deletions of one-quarter of yeast genes, focusing on (putative) regulators. The resulting genetic perturbation signatures reflect many different properties. These include the architecture of protein complexes and pathways, identification of expression changes compatible with viability, and the varying responsiveness to genetic perturbation. The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop (FFL) types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 FFLs that likely represent feedback. Systematic transcription factor classification shows a surprisingly high abundance of gene-specific repressors, suggesting that yeast chromatin is not as generally restrictive to transcription as is often assumed. The data set is useful for studying individual genes and for discovering properties of an entire regulatory system.},

As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.

RESULTS: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we propose FMD-index for forward-backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an FMD-index.

abstract = {Prions are self-propagating, infectious proteins that underlie several neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular basis underlying their sporadic formation is poorly understood. We show that autophagy protects against de novo formation of [PSI(+)], which is the prion form of the yeast Sup35 translation termination factor. Autophagy is a cellular degradation system, and preventing autophagy by mutating its core components elevates the frequency of spontaneous [PSI(+)] formation. Conversely, increasing autophagic flux by treating cells with the polyamine spermidine suppresses prion formation in mutants that normally show a high frequency of de novo prion formation. Autophagy also protects against the de novo formation of another prion, namely the Rnq1/[PIN(+)] prion, which is not related in sequence to the Sup35/[PSI(+)] prion. We show that growth under anaerobic conditions in the absence of molecular oxygen abrogates Sup35 protein damage and suppresses the high frequency of [PSI(+)] formation in an autophagy mutant. Autophagy therefore normally functions to remove oxidatively damaged Sup35, which accumulates in cells grown under aerobic conditions, but in the absence of autophagy, damaged/misfolded Sup35 undergoes structural transitions favoring its conversion to the propagatable [PSI(+)] form.},

abstract = {Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are common genetic elements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are reported in other eukaryotes as well. EccDNAs contribute to genetic variation among somatic cells in multicellular organisms and to evolution of unicellular eukaryotes. Sensitive methods for detecting eccDNA are needed to clarify how these elements affect genome stability and how environmental and biological factors induce their formation in eukaryotic cells. This video presents a sensitive eccDNA-purification method called Circle-Seq. The method encompasses column purification of circular DNA, removal of remaining linear chromosomal DNA, rolling-circle amplification of eccDNA, deep sequencing, and mapping. Extensive exonuclease treatment was required for sufficient linear chromosomal DNA degradation. The rolling-circle amplification step by $\phi$29 polymerase enriched for circular DNA over linear DNA. Validation of the Circle-Seq method on three S. cerevisiae CEN.PK populations of 10(10) cells detected hundreds of eccDNA profiles in sizes larger than 1 kilobase. Repeated findings of ASP3-1, COS111, CUP1, RSC30, HXT6, HXT7 genes on circular DNA in both S288c and CEN.PK suggests that DNA circularization is conserved between strains at these loci. In sum, the Circle-Seq method has broad applicability for genome-scale screening for eccDNA in eukaryotes as well as for detecting specific eccDNA types.},

abstract = {Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression and DNA damage repair. Although structurally well studied, the underlying determinant of cohesion establishment on chromosomal arms remains enigmatic. Here, we show two populations of functionally distinct cohesin on chromosomal arms using a combination of genomics and single-locus specific DNA-FISH analysis. Chromatin bound cohesin at the loading sites co-localizes with Pds5 and Eso1 resulting in stable cohesion. In contrast, cohesin independent of its loader is unable to maintain cohesion and associates with chromatin in a dynamic manner. Cohesive sites coincide with highly expressed genes and transcription inhibition leads to destabilization of cohesin on chromatin. Furthermore, induction of transcription results inde novorecruitment of cohesive cohesin. Our data suggest that transcription facilitates cohesin loading onto chromosomal arms and is a key determinant of cohesive sites in fission yeast.},

In the present study, we investigated wine yeast adaptation to chronic mild alcohol stress when cells were cultured for 100 generations in the presence of non-cytotoxic ethanol concentration. Ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide signals promoted growth rate during passages that was accompanied by increased expression of sirtuin proteins, Sir1, Sir2 and Sir3, and DNA-binding transcription regulator Rap1. Genome-wide array-CGH analysis revealed that yeast genome was shaped during passages. The gains of chromosomes I, III and VI and significant changes in the gene copy number in nine functional gene categories involved in metabolic processes and stress responses were observed. Ethanol-mediated gains of  YRF1  and  CUP1  genes were the most accented. Ethanol also induced nucleolus fragmentation that confirms that nucleolus is a stress sensor in yeasts. Taken together, we postulate that wine yeasts of different origin may adapt to mild alcohol stress by shifts in intracellular redox state promoting growth capacity, upregulation of key regulators of longevity, namely sirtuins and changes in the dosage of genes involved in the telomere maintenance and ion detoxification.},

@article{Berman2016,
abstract = {Organisms must be able to grow in a broad range of conditions found in their normal growth environment and for a species to survive, at least some cells in a population must adapt rapidly to extreme stress conditions that kill the majority of cells. Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans resides as a commensal in a broad range of niches within the human host. Growth conditions in these niches are highly variable and stresses such exposure to antifungal drugs can inhibit population growth abruptly. One of the mechanisms C. albicans uses to adapt rapidly to severe stresses is aneuploidy-a change in the total number of chromosomes such that one or more chromosomes are present in excess or are missing. Aneuploidy is quite common in wild isolates of fungi and other eukaryotic microbes. Aneuploidy can be achieved by chromosome nondisjunction during a simple mitosis, and in stress conditions it begins to appear after two mitotic divisions via a tetraploid intermediate. Aneuploidy usually resolves to euploidy (a balanced number of chromosomes), but not necessarily to diploidy. Aneuploidy of a specific chromosome can confer new phenotypes by virtue of the copy number of specific genes on that chromosome relative to the copies of other genes. Thus, it is not aneuploidy per se, but the relative copy number of specific genes that confers many tested aneuploidy-associated phenotypes. Aneuploidy almost always carries a fitness cost, as cells express most proteins encoded by genes on the aneuploid chromosome in proportion to the number of DNA copies of the gene. This is thought to be due to imbalances in the stoichiometry of different components of large complexes. Despite this, fitness is a relative function-and if stress is severe and population growth has slowed considerably, then even small growth advantages of some aneuploidies can provide a selective advantage. Thus, aneuploidy appears to provide a transient solution to severe and sudden stress conditions, and may promote the appearance of more stable solutions as well. Importantly, in many clinical and environmental isolates of different fungal species aneuploidy does not appear to have a high fitness cost, and is well-tolerated. Thus, rapid changes in ploidy may provide the opportunity for rapid adaptation to stress conditions in the environment, host niches or in response to antifungal drugs.},

We also profiled transcriptome abundance in naturally aneuploid isolates and found that 10-30{\%} of amplified genes, depending on the strain and affected chromosome, show lower-than-expected expression compared to gene copy number. We argued that this gene group is enriched for genes subject to one or more modes of dosage compensation, where mRNA abundance is decreased in response to higher dosage of that gene. A recent manuscript by Torres et al. refutes our prior work. Here we provide a response to Torres et al., along with additional analysis and controls to support our original conclusions. We maintain that aneuploidy is well tolerated in the wild strains of S. cerevisiae that we studied and that the group of genes enriched for those subject to dosage compensation show unique evolutionary signatures.},

This is true when the copy number of individual genes or entire chromosomes is altered. In a recent study, Hose et al. (2015) reported that this tight correlation between gene copy number and RNA levels is not observed in recently isolated wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae variants. To understand the origins of this proposed difference in gene expression regulation between natural variants and laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae, we evaluated the karyotype and gene expression studies performed by Hose et al. on wild S. cerevisiae strains. In contrast to the results of Hose et al., our reexamination of their data revealed a tight correlation between gene copy number and gene expression.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering of individuals into populations on the basis of multilocus genotypes is informative in a variety of settings. In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) 'label switching' of clusters across replicates, caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled, and (2) 'genuine multimodality,' truly distinct solutions across replicates.

RESULTS: To facilitate the interpretation of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP (CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100 replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.

RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

The new prior distributions allow the proportion of individuals assigned to a particular cluster to vary by location. The models are tested on simulated data, and illustrated using microsatellite data from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. We demonstrate that the new models allow structure to be detected at lower levels of divergence, or with less data, than the original structure models or principal components methods, and that they are not biased towards detecting structure when it is not present.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

abstract = {Genetic instability is a hallmark of aneuploidy in budding and fission yeast. All aneuploid yeast strains analyzed to date harbor elevated levels of Rad52-GFP foci, a sign of DNA damage. Here we investigate how continuously elevated levels of DNA damage affect aneuploid cells. We show that Rad52-GFP foci form during S phase, consistent with the observation that DNA replication initiation and elongation are impaired in some aneuploid yeast strains. We furthermore find that although DNA damage is low in aneuploid cells, it nevertheless has dramatic consequences. Many aneuploid yeast strains adapt to DNA damage and undergo mitosis despite the presence of unrepaired DNA leading to cell death. Wild-type cells exposed to low levels of DNA damage exhibit a similar phenotype, indicating that adaptation to low levels of unrepaired DNA is a general property of the cell's response to DNA damage. Our results indicate that by causing low levels of DNA damage, whole-chromosome aneuploidies lead to DNA breaks that persist into mitosis. Such breaks provide the substrate for translocations and deletions that are a hallmark of cancer.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy is considered a widespread genetic variation in such cell populations as yeast strains, cell lines and cancer cells, and spontaneous changes in the chromosomal copy number may have implications for data interpretation. Thus, aneuploidy monitoring is essential during routine laboratory practice, especially while conducting biochemical and/or gene expression analyses. In the present study, we constructed a panel of whole chromosome painting probes (WCPPs) to monitor aneuploidy in a single yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell. The WCPP-based system was validated using "normal" haploid and diploid cells, as well as disomic cells both with and without cell synchronisation. FISH that utilised WCPPs was combined with DNA cell cycle analysis (imaging cytometry) to provide a detailed analysis of signal variability during the cell cycle. Chromosome painting can be utilised to detect spontaneously formed disomic chromosomes and study aneuploidy-promoting conditions. For example, the frequency of disomic chromosomes was increased in cells lacking NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2p compared with wild-type cells (p<0.05). In conclusion, WCPPs may be considered to be a powerful molecular tool to identify individual genomic differences. Moreover, the WCPP-based system may be used at the single-cell level of analysis to supplement array-based techniques and high-throughput analyses at the population scale.},

abstract = {Polyploidy is observed across the tree of life, yet its influence on evolution remains incompletely understood. Polyploidy, usually whole-genome duplication, is proposed to alter the rate of evolutionary adaptation. This could occur through complex effects on the frequency or fitness of beneficial mutations. For example, in diverse cell types and organisms, immediately after a whole-genome duplication, newly formed polyploids missegregate chromosomes and undergo genetic instability. The instability following whole-genome duplications is thought to provide adaptive mutations in microorganisms and can promote tumorigenesis in mammalian cells. Polyploidy may also affect adaptation independently of beneficial mutations through ploidy-specific changes in cell physiology. Here we perform in vitro evolution experiments to test directly whether polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation. Compared with haploids and diploids, tetraploids undergo significantly faster adaptation. Mathematical modelling suggests that rapid adaptation of tetraploids is driven by higher rates of beneficial mutations with stronger fitness effects, which is supported by whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic analyses of evolved clones. Chromosome aneuploidy, concerted chromosome loss, and point mutations all provide large fitness gains. We identify several mutations whose beneficial effects are manifest specifically in the tetraploid strains. Together, these results provide direct quantitative evidence that in some environments polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation.},

@article{Dodgson2016,
abstract = {Aneuploidy, an unbalanced karyotype in which one or more chromosomes are present in excess or reduced copy number, causes an array of known phenotypes including proteotoxicity, genomic instability and slowed proliferation. However, the molecular consequences of aneuploidy are poorly understood and an unbiased investigation into aneuploid cell biology is lacking. We performed high-throughput screens for genes whose deletion has a synthetic fitness cost in aneuploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells containing single extra chromosomes. This analysis identified genes that when deleted decrease the fitness of specific disomic strains as well as those that impair the proliferation of a broad range of aneuploidies. In one case, a chromosome-specific synthetic growth defect could be explained fully by the specific duplication of a single gene on the aneuploid chromosome, highlighting the ability of individual dosage imbalances to cause chromosome-specific phenotypes in aneuploid cells. Deletion of other genes, particularly those involved in protein transport, however, confers synthetic sickness on a broad array of aneuploid strains. Indeed, aneuploid cells, regardless of karyotype, exhibit protein secretion and cell wall integrity defects. Thus, we were able to use this screen to identify novel cellular consequences of aneuploidy, dependent on both specific chromosome imbalances as well as caused by many different aneuploid karyotypes. Interestingly, the vast majority of cancer cells are highly aneuploid, so this approach could be of further use in identifying both karyotype-specific and nonspecific stresses exhibited by cancer cells as potential targets for the development of novel cancer therapeutics.},

To understand the origins of this proposed difference in gene expression regulation between natural variants and laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae, we evaluated the karyotype and gene expression studies performed by Hose et al. on wild S. cerevisiae strains. In contrast to the results of Hose et al., our reexamination of their data revealed a tight correlation between gene copy number and gene expression.

A cloned ochre-suppressing form of a tRNA gene, SUP11, serves as a marker on natural and in vitro-constructed chromosomes. In diploid strains homozygous for an ochre mutation in ade2, cells carrying no copies of the SUP11 gene are red, those carrying one copy are pink, and those carrying two or more copies are white. Thus, the degree of red sectoring in colonies reflects the frequency of mitotic chromosome loss. The assay also distinguishes between chromosome loss (1:0 segregation) and nondisjunction (2:0 segregation). The most dramatic effect on improving mitotic stability is caused by increasing chromosome size. Circular chromosomes increase in stability through a size range up to approximately 100 kb, but do not continue to be stabilized above this value. However, linear chromosomes continue to increase in mitotic stability throughout the size range tested (up to 137 kb). It is possible that the mitotic stability of linear chromosomes is proportional to chromosome length, up to a plateau value that has not yet been reached in our synthetic constructions.},

Although many domesticated plants and animals have been systematically compared with their wild genetic stocks, the molecular and genomic processes underlying fungal domestication have received less attention. Here, we present a nearly complete genome assembly for the recently described yeast species Saccharomyces eubayanus and compare it to the genomes of multiple domesticated alloploid hybrids of S. eubayanus × S. cerevisiae (S. pastorianus syn. S. carlsbergensis), which are used to brew lager-style beers. We find that the S. eubayanus subgenomes of lager-brewing yeasts have experienced increased rates of evolution since hybridization, and that certain genes involved in metabolism may have been particularly affected. Interestingly, the S. eubayanus subgenome underwent an especially strong shift in selection regimes, consistent with more extensive domestication of the S. cerevisiae parent prior to hybridization. In contrast to recent proposals that lager-brewing yeasts were domesticated following a single hybridization event, the radically different neutral site divergences between the subgenomes of the two major lager yeast lineages strongly favor at least two independent origins for the S. cerevisiae × S. eubayanus hybrids that brew lager beers. Our findings demonstrate how this industrially important hybrid has been domesticated along similar evolutionary trajectories on multiple occasions.},

@article{Qi2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meiotic recombination alters frequency and distribution of genetic variation, impacting genetics and evolution. In the budding yeast, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and D loops form either crossovers (COs) or non-crossovers (NCOs), which occur at many sites in the genome. Differences at the nucleotide level associated with COs and NCOs enable us to detect these recombination events and their distributions.

RESULTS: We used high throughput sequencing to uncover over 46 thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two budding yeast strains and investigated meiotic recombinational events. We provided a detailed analysis of CO and NCO events, including number, size range, and distribution on chromosomes. We have detected 91 COs, very close to the average number from previous genetic studies, as well as 21 NCO events and mapped the positions of these events with high resolution. We have obtained DNA sequence-level evidence for a wide range of sizes of chromosomal regions involved in CO and NCO events. We show that a large fraction of the COs are accompanied by gene conversion (GC), indicating that meiotic recombination changes allelic frequencies, in addition to redistributing existing genetic variations.

CONCLUSION: This work is the first reported study of meiotic recombination using high throughput sequencing technologies. Our results show that high-throughput sequencing is a sensitive method to uncover at single-base resolution details of CO and NCO events, including some complex patterns, providing new clues about the mechanism of this fundamental process.},

abstract = {Expansion of a poly-glutamine (polyQ) repeat in a group of functionally unrelated proteins is the cause of several inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. The polyQ length-dependent aggregation and toxicity of these disease proteins can be reproduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system allowed us to screen for genes that when overexpressed reduce the toxic effects of an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin with 103 Q. Surprisingly, among the identified suppressors were three proteins with Q-rich, prion-like domains (PrDs): glycine threonine serine repeat protein (Gts1p), nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 3, and minichromosome maintenance protein 1. Overexpression of the PrD of Gts1p, containing an imperfect 28 residue glutamine-alanine repeat, was sufficient for suppression of toxicity. Association with this discontinuous polyQ domain did not prevent 103Q aggregation, but altered the physical properties of the aggregates, most likely early in the assembly pathway, as reflected in their increased SDS solubility. Molecular simulations suggested that Gts1p arrests the aggregation of polyQ molecules at the level of nonfibrillar species, acting as a cap that destabilizes intermediates on path to form large fibrils. Quantitative proteomic analysis of polyQ interactors showed that expression of Gts1p reduced the interaction between polyQ and other prion-like proteins, and enhanced the association of molecular chaperones with the aggregates. These findings demonstrate that short, Q-rich peptides are able to shield the interactive surfaces of toxic forms of polyQ proteins and direct them into nontoxic aggregates.},

Recent studies have assessed the three-dimensional (3D) co-localization of functional annotations (e.g. centromeres, long terminal repeats) using 3D genome reconstructions from Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) data; however, corresponding assessments for continuous functional genomic data (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) peak height) are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that applying bump hunting via the patient rule induction method (PRIM) to ChIP-seq data superposed on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3D genome reconstruction can discover 'functional 3D hotspots', regions in 3-space for which the mean ChIP-seq peak height is significantly elevated. For the transcription factor Swi6, the top hotspot by P-value contains MSB2 and ERG11 - known Swi6 target genes on different chromosomes. We verify this finding in a number of ways. First, this top hotspot is relatively stable under PRIM across parameter settings. Second, this hotspot is among the top hotspots by mean outcome identified by an alternative algorithm, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression. Third, the distance between MSB2 and ERG11 is smaller than expected (by resampling) in two other 3D reconstructions generated via different normalization and reconstruction algorithms. This analytic approach can discover functional 3D hotspots and potentially reveal novel regulatory interactions.},

Furthermore, this microarray design allowed the detection of multiple introgressed S. paradoxus DNA fragments in the genomes of three different S. cerevisiae isolates. These results show the power of multispecies-based microarrays as taxonomic tools for the identification of species and interspecies hybrids, and their ability to provide a more detailed characterization of interspecies hybrids and recombinants.},

As one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. To answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes (CEGs), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. From an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of CEGs mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used N50 length and x-fold coverage values.},

abstract = {At near-freezing temperatures (0-4°C), the growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae stops or is severely limited, and viability decreases. Under these conditions, yeast cells trigger a biochemical response, in which trehalose and glycerol accumulate and protect them against severe cold and freeze injury. However, the mechanisms that allow yeast cells to sustain this response have been not clarified. The effects of severe cold on the proteome of S. cerevisiae have been not investigated and its importance in providing cell survival at near-freezing temperatures and upon freezing remains unknown. Here, we have compared the protein profile of two industrial baker's yeast strains at 30°C and 4°C. Overall, a total of 16 proteins involved in energy-metabolism, translation and redox homeostasis were identified as showing increased abundance at 4°C. The predominant presence of glycolytic proteins among those upregulated at 4°C, likely represents a mechanism to maintain a constant supply of ATP for the synthesis of glycerol and other protective molecules. Accumulation of these molecules is by far the most important component in enhancing viability of baker's yeast strains upon freezing. Overexpression of genes encoding certain proteins associated with translation or redox homeostasis provided specifically protection against extreme cold damage, underlying the importance of these functions in the near-freezing response.},

abstract = {Chromosome instability (CIN) is observed in most solid tumors and is linked to somatic mutations in genome integrity maintenance genes. The spectrum of mutations that cause CIN is only partly known and it is not possible to predict a priori all pathways whose disruption might lead to CIN. To address this issue, we generated a catalogue of CIN genes and pathways by screening ∼ 2,000 reduction-of-function alleles for 90{\%} of essential genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Integrating this with published CIN phenotypes for other yeast genes generated a systematic CIN gene dataset comprised of 692 genes. Enriched gene ontology terms defined cellular CIN pathways that, together with sequence orthologs, created a list of human CIN candidate genes, which we cross-referenced to published somatic mutation databases revealing hundreds of mutated CIN candidate genes. Characterization of some poorly characterized CIN genes revealed short telomeres in mutants of the ASTRA/TTT components TTI1 and ASA1. High-throughput phenotypic profiling links ASA1 to TTT (Tel2-Tti1-Tti2) complex function and to TORC1 signaling via Tor1p stability, consistent with the role of TTT in PI3-kinase related kinase biogenesis. The comprehensive CIN gene list presented here in principle comprises all conserved eukaryotic genome integrity pathways. Deriving human CIN candidate genes from the list allows direct cross-referencing with tumor mutational data and thus candidate mutations potentially driving CIN in tumors. Overall, the CIN gene spectrum reveals new chromosome biology and will help us to understand CIN phenotypes in human disease.},

abstract = {It has been more than two decades since the original chromosome transmission fidelity (Ctf) screen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was published. Since that time the spectrum of mutations known to cause Ctf and, more generally, chromosome instability (CIN) has expanded dramatically as a result of systematic screens across yeast mutant arrays. Here we describe a comprehensive summary of the original Ctf genetic screen and the cloning of the remaining complementation groups as efforts to expand our knowledge of the CIN gene repertoire and its mutability in a model eukaryote. At the time of the original screen, it was impossible to predict either the genes and processes that would be overrepresented in a pool of random mutants displaying a Ctf phenotype or what the entire set of genes potentially mutable to Ctf would be. We show that in a collection of 136 randomly selected Ctf mutants, >65{\%} of mutants map to 13 genes, 12 of which are involved in sister chromatid cohesion and/or kinetochore function. Extensive screening of systematic mutant collections has shown that {\~{}}350 genes with functions as diverse as RNA processing and proteasomal activity mutate to cause a Ctf phenotype and at least 692 genes are required for faithful chromosome segregation. The enrichment of random Ctf alleles in only 13 of {\~{}}350 possible Ctf genes suggests that these genes are more easily mutable to cause genome instability than the others. These observations inform our understanding of recurring CIN mutations in human cancers where presumably random mutations are responsible for initiating the frequently observed CIN phenotype of tumors.},

abstract = {Gain or loss of chromosomes resulting in aneuploidy can be important factors in cancer and adaptive evolution. Although chromosome gain is a frequent event in eukaryotes, there is limited information on its genetic control. Here we measured the rates of chromosome gain in wild-type yeast and sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) compromised strains. SCC tethers the newly replicated chromatids until anaphase via the cohesin complex. Chromosome gain was measured by selecting and characterizing copper-resistant colonies that emerged due to increased copies of the metallothionein gene CUP1. Although all defective SCC diploid strains exhibited increased rates of chromosome gain, there were 15-fold differences between them. Of all mutants examined, a hypomorphic mutation at the cohesin complex caused the highest rate of chromosome gain while disruption of WPL1, an important regulator of SCC and chromosome condensation, resulted in the smallest increase in chromosome gain. In addition to defects in SCC, yeast cell type contributed significantly to chromosome gain, with the greatest rates observed for homozygous mating-type diploids, followed by heterozygous mating type, and smallest in haploids. In fact, wpl1-deficient haploids did not show any difference in chromosome gain rates compared to wild-type haploids. Genomic analysis of copper-resistant colonies revealed that the "driver" chromosome for which selection was applied could be amplified to over five copies per diploid cell. In addition, an increase in the expected driver chromosome was often accompanied by a gain of a small number of other chromosomes. We suggest that while chromosome gain due to SCC malfunction can have negative effects through gene imbalance, it could also facilitate opportunities for adaptive changes. In multicellular organisms, both factors could lead to somatic diseases including cancer.},

Chromothripsis is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number levels, all curiously restricted to one or a few chromosomes. The mechanism for chromothripsis is unknown, but we previously proposed that it could occur through the physical isolation of chromosomes in aberrant nuclear structures called micronuclei. Here, using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell genome sequencing, we demonstrate that micronucleus formation can indeed generate a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known features of chromothripsis. These events are restricted to the mis-segregated chromosome and occur within one cell division. We demonstrate that the mechanism for chromothripsis can involve the fragmentation and subsequent reassembly of a single chromatid from a micronucleus. Collectively, these experiments establish a new mutational process of which chromothripsis is one extreme outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising source of renewable biofuels. However, pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass generates fermentation inhibitors that adversely affect the growth of industrial microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and prevent economic production of lignocellulosic biofuels. A critical challenge on developing S. cerevisiae with improved inhibitor resistance lies in incomplete understanding of molecular basis for inhibitor stress response and limited information on effective genetic targets for increasing yeast resistance to mixed fermentation inhibitors. In this study, we applied comparative transcriptomic analysis to determine the molecular basis for acetic acid and/or furfural resistance in S. cerevisiae.

RESULTS: We recently developed a yeast strain YC1 with superior resistance to acetic acid, furfural, and their mixture through inverse metabolic engineering. In this study, we first determined transcriptional changes through RNA sequencing in YC1 versus the wild-type strain S-C1 under three different inhibitor conditions, including acetic acid alone, furfural alone, and mixture of acetic acid and furfural. The genes associated with stress responses of S. cerevisiae to single and mixed inhibitors were revealed. Specifically, we identified 184 consensus genes that were differentially regulated in response to the distinct inhibitor resistance between YC1 and S-C1. Bioinformatic analysis next revealed key transcription factors (TFs) that regulate these consensus genes. The top TFs identified, Sfp1p and Ace2p, were experimentally tested as overexpression targets for strain optimization. Overexpression of the SFP1 gene improved specific ethanol productivity by nearly four times, while overexpression of the ACE2 gene enhanced the rate by three times in the presence of acetic acid and furfural. Overexpression of SFP1 gene in the resistant strain YC1 further resulted in 42 {\%} increase in ethanol productivity in the presence of acetic acid and furfural, suggesting the effect of Sfp1p in optimizing the yeast strain for improved tolerance to mixed fermentation inhibitor.

CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional regulation underlying yeast resistance to acetic acid and furfural was determined. Two transcription factors, Sfp1p and Ace2p, were uncovered for the first time for their functions in improving yeast resistance to mixed fermentation inhibitors. The study demonstrated an omics-guided metabolic engineering framework, which could be developed as a promising strategy to improve complex microbial phenotypes.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy and aging are correlated; however, a causal link between these two phenomena has remained elusive. Here, we show that yeast disomic for a single native yeast chromosome generally have a decreased replicative lifespan. In addition, the extent of this lifespan deficit correlates with the size of the extra chromosome. We identified a mutation in BUL1 that rescues both the lifespan deficit and a protein trafficking defect in yeast disomic for chromosome 5. Bul1 is an E4 ubiquitin ligase adaptor involved in a protein quality control pathway that targets membrane proteins for endocytosis and destruction in the lysosomal vacuole, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis. Concurrent suppression of the aging and trafficking phenotypes suggests that disrupted membrane protein homeostasis in aneuploid yeast may contribute to their accelerated aging. The data reported here demonstrate that aneuploidy can impair protein homeostasis, shorten lifespan, and may contribute to age-associated phenotypes.},

abstract = {In 1982, the term "prions" (proteinaceous infectious particles) was coined to specify a new principle of infection. A misfolded isoform of a cellular protein has been described as the causative agent of a fatal neurodegenerative disease. At the beginning of prion research scientists assumed that the infectious agent causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) was a virus, but some unconventional properties of these pathogens were difficult to bring in line with the prevailing viral model. The discovery that prions (obviously devoid of any coding nucleic acid) can store and transmit information similarly to DNA was initially even denoted as being "heretical" but is nowadays mainly accepted by the scientific community. This review describes, from a historical point of view, how the "protein-only hypothesis" expands the Central Dogma. Definition of both, the prion principle and the Central Dogma, have been essential steps to understand information storage and transfer within and among cells and organisms. Furthermore, the current understanding of the infectivity of prion-proteins after misfolding is summarized succinctly. Finally, prion-like amyloids and functional amyloids, as found in yeast and bacteria, will be discussed.},

abstract = {Defining intracellular protein concentration is critical in molecular systems biology. Although strategies for determining relative protein changes are available, defining robust absolute values in copies per cell has proven significantly more challenging. Here we present a reference dataset quantifying over 1800 S. cerevisiae proteins by direct means using protein-specific stable-isotope labelled internal standards and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry, far exceeding any previous study. This was achieved by careful design of over 100 QconCAT recombinant proteins as standards, defining 1167 proteins in terms of copies per cell and upper limits on a further 668, with robust CVs routinely less than 20{\%}. The SRM-derived proteome is compared with existing quantitative data sets, highlighting the disparities between methodologies. Coupled with a quantification of the transcriptome by RNA-seq taken from the same cells, these data support revised estimates of several fundamental molecular parameters: a total protein count of {\~{}}100 million molecules-per-cell, a median of {\~{}}1000 proteins-per-transcript, and a linear model of protein translation explaining 70{\%} of the variance in translation rate. This work contributes a 'gold-standard' reference yeast proteome (including 532 values based on high quality, dual peptide quantification) that can be widely used in systems models and for other comparative studies.},

abstract = {The Target of Rapamycin Complex I (TORC1) orchestrates global reprogramming of transcriptional programs in response to myriad environmental conditions, yet despite the commonality of the TORC1 complex components, different TORC1-inhibitory conditions do not elicit a uniform transcriptional response. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC1 regulates the expression of nitrogen catabolite repressed (NCR) genes by controlling the nuclear translocation of the NCR transactivator Gln3. Moreover, Golgi-to-endosome trafficking was shown to be required for nuclear translocation of Gln3 upon a shift from rich medium to the poor nitrogen source proline, but not upon rapamycin treatment. Here, we employed microarray profiling to survey the full impact of the vesicular trafficking system on yeast TORC1-orchestrated transcriptional programs. In addition to the NCR genes, we found that ribosomal protein, ribosome biogenesis, phosphate-responsive, and sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism genes are perturbed by disruption of Golgi-to-endosome trafficking following a nutritional shift from rich to poor nitrogen source medium, but not upon rapamycin treatment. Similar to Gln3, defects in Golgi-to-endosome trafficking significantly delayed cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of Sfp1, but did not detectably affect the cytoplasmic-nuclear or nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of Met4, which are the transactivators of these genes. Thus, Golgi-to-endosome trafficking defects perturb TORC1 transcriptional programs via multiple mechanisms. Our findings further delineate the downstream transcriptional responses of TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin compared with a nitrogen quality downshift. Given the conservation of both TORC1 and endomembrane networks throughout eukaryotes, our findings may also have implications for TORC1-mediated responses to nutritional cues in mammals and other eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae histidine auxotrophs are unable to use L-histidinol as a source of histidine even when they have a functional histidinol dehydrogenase. Mutations in the hol1 gene permit growth of His- cells on histidinol by enhancing the ability of cells to take up histidinol from the medium. Second-site mutations linked to HOL1-1 further increase histidinol uptake. HOL1 double mutants and, to a lesser extent, HOL1-1 single mutants show hypersensitivity to specific cations added to the growth medium, including Na+, Li+, Cs+, Be2+, guanidinium ion, and histidinol, but not K+, Rb+, Ca2+, or Mg2+. The Na(+)-hypersensitive phenotype is correlated with increased uptake and accumulation of this ion. The HOL1-1-101 gene was cloned and used to generate a viable haploid strain containing a hol1 deletion mutation (hol1 delta). The uptake of cations, the dominance of the mutant alleles, and the relative inability of hol1 delta cells to take up histidinol or Na+ suggest that hol1 encodes an ion transporter. The novel pattern of ion transport conferred by HOL1-1 and HOL1-1-101 mutants may be explained by reduced selectivity for the permeant ions.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of the genes of higher eukaryotes has been aided by their expression in model organisms and by analyzing site-specific changes in homologous genes in model systems such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Modifying sequences in yeast or other organisms such that no heterologous material is retained requires in vitro mutagenesis together with subcloning. PCR-based procedures that do not involve cloning are inefficient or require multistep reactions that increase the risk of additional mutations. An alternative approach, demonstrated in yeast, relies on transformation with an oligonucleotide, but the method is restricted to the generation of mutants with a selectable phenotype. Oligonucleotides, when combined with gap repair, have also been used to modify plasmids in yeast; however, this approach is limited by restriction-site availability. We have developed a mutagenesis approach in yeast based on transformation by unpurified oligonucleotides that allows the rapid creation of site-specific DNA mutations in vivo. A two-step, cloning-free process, referred to as delitto perfetto, generates products having only the desired mutation, such as a single or multiple base change, an insertion, a small or a large deletion, or even random mutations. The system provides for multiple rounds of mutation in a window up to 200 base pairs. The process is RAD52 dependent, is not constrained by the distribution of naturally occurring restriction sites, and requires minimal DNA sequencing. Because yeast is commonly used for random and selective cloning of genomic DNA from higher eukaryotes such as yeast artificial chromosomes, the delitto perfetto strategy also provides an efficient way to create precise changes in mammalian or other DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Gene manipulation serves the purpose of providing a better understanding of the function of specific genes as well as for developing novel variants of the genes of interest. The generation of knockout genes, the alteration, depletion, or enhancement of a particular gene function through the generation of specific gene mutations, or the generation of random mutations in a gene are all essential processes for gene manipulation. The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is relatively easy to modify, owing to its efficient homologous recombination (HR) system. Gene knockout can be a very simple, one-step approach to eliminate a gene by substituting its DNA sequence with that of a genetic marker. Differently, desired mutations can be introduced into a gene by replacing the sequence of the normal gene with that of the mutated gene. Recombinant DNA can be created in vitro and then introduced into cells, most often exploiting the endogenous recombination system of the cells. However, unless the desired mutation gives a particular phenotype, a bottleneck of 'recombineering' is the requirement of a selection system to identify the recombinant clones among those unmodified. Even in an organism like yeast where the level of HR is highly above the incidence of random integration, the frequency of homologous targeting is in the range of 10(-4)-10(-6) depending on the length of the homology used (Wach et al., 1994). Thus, a selection system is always required to identify the targeted clones. Counterselectable markers, such as URA3, LYS2, LYS5, MET15, and TRP1 (Bach and LaCroute, 1972; Chattoo et al., 1979; Singh and Sherman, 1974; Toyn et al., 2000), are widely utilized in yeast and can be recycled for additional usage in the same yeast strain. If the marker is not eliminated or it is popped out via site-specific recombination between direct repeats, such as in the Flp/FRT or Cre/Lox systems, a heterologous sequence is left as a scar at the site of the modified DNA (Storici et al., 1999; Sauer, 1987). The presence of such scars can threaten the genomic stability of the strain and/or limit the number of successive genetic manipulations for that strain. Here, we describe the delitto perfetto approach for in vivo mutagenesis that combines the practicality of a general selection system with the versatility of synthetic oligonucleotides for targeting (Storici et al., 2001). It provides for generation of gene knockouts and almost any sort of mutation and genome rearrangement via HR. The delitto perfetto in vivo mutagenesis technique is designed for efficient and precise manipulation of yeast strains in a two-step process spanning {\~{}}2 weeks. Here, we present the theory and procedures of the delitto perfetto technique.},

abstract = {We showed previously that the increased rate of mRNA turnover associated with premature translational termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a functional UPF1 gene product. In this study, we show that the UPF1 gene codes for a 109-kDa primary translation product whose function is not essential for growth. The protein contains a potential zinc-dependent nucleic acid-binding domain and a nucleoside triphosphate-binding domain. A 300-amino-acid segment of the UPF1 protein is 36{\%} identical to a segment of the yeast SEN1 protein, which is required for endonucleolytic processing of intron-containing pre-tRNAs. The same region is 32{\%} identical to a segment of Mov-10, a mouse protein of unknown function. Dominant-negative upf1 mutations were isolated following in vitro mutagenesis of a plasmid containing the UPF1 gene. They mapped exclusively at conserved positions within the sequence element common to all three proteins, whereas the recessive upf1-2 mutation maps outside this region. The clustering of dominant-negative mutations suggests the presence of a functional domain in UPF1 that may be shared by all three proteins. We also identified upf mutations in three other genes designated UPF2, UPF3, and UPF4. When alleles of each gene were screened for effects on mRNA accumulation, we found that the recessive mutation upf3-1 causes increased accumulation of mRNA containing a premature stop codon. When mRNA half-lives were measured, we found that excess mRNA accumulation was due to mRNA stabilization. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the products of at least two genes, UPF1 and UPF3, are responsible for the accelerated rate of mRNA decay associated with premature translational termination.},

abstract = {DNA molecules created by fusing a 365-base-pair segment of yeast DNA encoding the galactose-regulated upstream promoter element (gal) to a set of derivatives that systematically delete sequences upstream from the his3 gene are introduced in single copy back into the yeast genome precisely at the his3 locus and then assayed for transcription. Fusions of the gal regulatory element to his3 derivatives containing all normal mRNA coding sequences but lacking essentially the entire promoter region fail to express his3 under any growth conditions. Fusions to derivatives lacking the his3 upstream promoter element but containing the "TATA box" place his3 expression under gal control--i.e., extremely high RNA levels in galactose-containing medium and essentially no his3 RNA in glucose-containing medium. However, of the two normal his3 initiation sites, only the downstream one is activated by the gal element. In fusions of this type, neither the orientation of the gal element nor the distance between the element and the his3 TATA box affects the level or the initiation points of transcription. However, the gal element does not influence transcription when placed 100 or 300 base pairs downstream from the normal mRNA start sites. Fusions to derivatives containing the entire his3 promoter region restore the basal level of his3 transcription in glucose-grown cells, and both transcriptional initiation sites are used. Furthermore, RNA levels in galactose-grown cells, although somewhat higher than in glucose-grown cells, are significantly below the fully induced level. The distance from his3 coding sequences does not affect RNA levels, suggesting that specific sequences, possibly corresponding to the his3 upstream promoter element, reduce the ability of the gal element to activate transcription. Analysis of chromatin from some of these strains indicates a DNase I-hypersensitive site(s) in the middle of the gal element. However, this structural feature is not correlated with transcriptional initiation because it is found when cells are grown in glucose medium and also in derivatives lacking a TATA box. Thus, the gal upstream element possesses most, but not all, of the properties of viral and cellular enhancer sequences of higher eukaryotes. In addition, it appears that the his3 and gal upstream sequences represent two distinct classes of promoter elements, which activate transcription from different initiation sites.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Domestic cats enjoy an extensive veterinary medical surveillance which has described nearly 250 genetic diseases analogous to human disorders. Feline infectious agents offer powerful natural models of deadly human diseases, which include feline immunodeficiency virus, feline sarcoma virus and feline leukemia virus. A rich veterinary literature of feline disease pathogenesis and the demonstration of a highly conserved ancestral mammal genome organization make the cat genome annotation a highly informative resource that facilitates multifaceted research endeavors.

FINDINGS: Here we report a preliminary annotation of the whole genome sequence of Cinnamon, a domestic cat living in Columbia (MO, USA), bisulfite sequencing of Boris, a male cat from St. Petersburg (Russia), and light 30× sequencing of Sylvester, a European wildcat progenitor of cat domestication. The annotation includes 21,865 protein-coding genes identified by a comparative approach, 217 loci of endogenous retrovirus-like elements, repetitive elements which comprise about 55.7{\%} of the whole genome, 99,494 new SNVs, 8,355 new indels, 743,326 evolutionary constrained elements, and 3,182 microRNA homologues. The methylation sites study shows that 10.5{\%} of cat genome cytosines are methylated. An assisted assembly of a European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris, was performed; variants between F. silvestris and F. catus genomes were derived and compared to F. catus.

CONCLUSIONS: The presented genome annotation extends beyond earlier ones by closing gaps of sequence that were unavoidable with previous low-coverage shotgun genome sequencing. The assembly and its annotation offer an important resource for connecting the rich veterinary and natural history of cats to genome discovery.},

Gene finding programs have achieved relatively high accuracy on short genomic sequences but do not perform well on longer sequences with an unknown number of genes in them. Here existing programs tend to predict many false exons.  Results: We have developed a new program, AUGUSTUS, for the ab initio prediction of protein coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. The program is based on a Hidden Markov Model and integrates a number of known methods and submodels. It employs a new way of modeling intron lengths. We use a new donor splice site model, a new model for a short region directly upstream of the donor splice site model that takes the reading frame into account and apply a method that allows better GC-content dependent parameter estimation. AUGUSTUS predicts on longer sequences far more human and drosophila genes accurately than the ab initio gene prediction programs we compared it with,   while at the same time being more specific.

abstract = {Gene duplication is an important source of evolutionary novelty. Most duplications are of just a single gene, but Ohno proposed that whole-genome duplication (polyploidy) is an important evolutionary mechanism. Many duplicate genes have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and these often seem to be phenotypically redundant. Here we show that the arrangement of duplicated genes in the S. cerevisiae genome is consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. We propose a model in which this species is a degenerate tetraploid resulting from a whole-genome duplication that occurred after the divergence of Saccharomyces from Kluyveromyces. Only a small fraction of the genes were subsequently retained in duplicate (most were deleted), and gene order was rearranged by many reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Protein pairs derived from this duplication event make up 13{\%} of all yeast proteins, and include pairs of transcription factors, protein kinases, myosins, cyclins and pheromones.

abstract = {The cloning of DNA fragments is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology. Traditional DNA cloning techniques rely on the ligation of an insert and a linearized plasmid that have been digested with restriction enzymes and the subsequent introduction of the ligated DNA into Escherichia coli for propagation. However, this method is limited by the availability of restriction sites, which often becomes problematic when cloning multiple or large DNA fragments. Furthermore, using traditional methods to clone multiple DNA fragments requires experience and multiple laborious steps. In this protocol, we describe a simple and efficient cloning method that relies on homologous recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to assemble multiple DNA fragments, with 30-bp homology regions between the fragments, into one sophisticated construct. This method can easily be extended to clone plasmids for other organisms, such as bacteria, plants, and mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Aggregation of the N-terminal human mutant huntingtin and the consequent toxicity in the yeast model of Huntington's disease (HD) requires the presence of Rnq1 protein (Rnq1p) in its prion conformation [RNQ1(+)]. The understanding of interaction of wild-type huntingtin (wt-Htt) with the amyloidogenic prion has some gaps. In this work, we show that N-terminal fragment of wt-Htt (N-wt-Htt) ameliorated the toxic effect of [RNQ1(+)] depending on expression levels of both proteins. When the expression of N-wt-Htt was high, it increased the expression and delayed the aggregation of [RNQ1(+)]. As the expression of N-wt-Htt was reduced, it formed high molecular weight aggregates along with the prion. Even when sequestered by [RNQ1(+)], the beneficial effect of N-wt-Htt on expression of Rnq1p and on cell survival was evident. Huntingtin protein ameliorated toxicity due to the prion protein [RNQ1(+)] in yeast cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in increase in cell survival, hinting at its probable role as a component of the proteostasis network of the cell. Taking into account the earlier reports of the beneficial effect of expression of N-wt-Htt on the aggregation of mutant huntingtin, the function of wild-type huntingtin as an inhibitor of protein aggregation in the cell needs to be explored.},

The above properties make the shuttle vectors suitable for construction of yeast genomic libraries and for cloning of DNA fragments defined by a large number of different restriction sites. The two vectors have been further modified by deletion of the sequences necessary for autonomous replication in yeast. The derivative plasmids YIp351 and YIp352 can therefore be used to integrate specific sequences into yeast chromosomal DNA.},

In strains completely deleted for the wild-type HIS3 gene, his3 fragments, one containing a deletion of 5' amino acid coding sequences and the other containing a deletion of 3' amino acid coding sequences, were first placed at preselected sites by homologous recombination. His+ revertants that arose via spontaneous mitotic recombination between the two his3 fragments were selected. This strategy was used to direct rearrangements in both RAD52+ and rad52 mutant strains. Translocations occurred in the RAD52+ genetic background and were characterized by orthogonal field alternating gel electrophoresis of yeast chromosomal DNA and by standard genetic techniques. An unexpected translocation was also identified in which HIS3 sequences were amplified. Two types of tandem duplications of the GAL(7, 10, 1) locus were also directed, and one type was not observed in rad52 mutants. Recombination mechanisms are discussed to account for these differences.},

abstract = {Industrial yeasts, economically important microorganisms, are widely used in diverse biotechnological processes including brewing, winemaking and distilling. In contrast to a well-established genome of brewer's and wine yeast strains, the comprehensive evaluation of genomic features of distillery strains is lacking. In the present study, twenty two distillery yeast strains were subjected to electrophoretic karyotyping and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The strains analyzed were assigned to the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex and grouped into four species categories: S. bayanus, S. paradoxus, S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii. The genomic diversity was mainly revealed within subtelomeric regions and the losses and/or gains of fragments of chromosomes I, III, VI and IX were the most frequently observed. Statistically significant differences in the gene copy number were documented in six functional gene categories: 1) telomere maintenance via recombination, DNA helicase activity or DNA binding, 2) maltose metabolism process, glucose transmembrane transporter activity; 3) asparagine catabolism, cellular response to nitrogen starvation, localized in cell wall-bounded periplasmic space, 4) siderophore transport, 5) response to copper ion, cadmium ion binding and 6) L-iditol 2- dehydrogenase activity. The losses of YRF1 genes (Y' element ATP-dependent helicase) were accompanied by decreased level of Y' sequences and an increase in DNA double and single strand breaks, and oxidative DNA damage in the S. paradoxus group compared to the S. bayanus group. We postulate that naturally occurring diversity in the YRF1 gene copy number may promote genetic stability in the S. bayanus group of distillery yeast strains.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.

RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools

In this paper, we present a new algorithm for finding tandem repeats which works without the need to specify either the pattern or pattern size. we model tandem repeats by percent identity and frequency of indels between adjacent pattern copies and use statistically based recognition criteria. We demonstrate the algorithm's speed and its ability to detect tandem repeats that have undergone extensive mutational change by analyzing four sequences: the human frataxin gene, the human {\{}beta{\}} T cell receptor locus sequence and two yeast chromosomes.

While available shuttle vectors are applicable in many experimental settings, their use in quantitative biology is hampered by insufficient copy number control. Moreover, they often have practical constraints, like limited modularity and few unique restriction sites. We constructed the pRG shuttle vector series consisting of single-copy and multi-copy integrative, centromeric, and episomal plasmids with marker genes for the selection in all commonly used auxotrophic yeast strains. The vectors feature a modular design and a large number of unique restriction sites, enabling an efficient exchange of every vector part and expansion of the series. Integration into the host genome is achieved using a double-crossover recombination mechanism resulting in stable single- and multi-copy modifications. As centromeric and episomal plasmids give rise to a heterogeneous cell population, an analysis of their copy number distribution and loss behavior was performed. Overall, the shuttle vector series supports the efficient cloning of genes and their maintenance in yeast cells with an improved copy number control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orthology analysis is an important part of data analysis in many areas of bioinformatics such as comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetics. The ever-increasing flood of sequence data, and hence the rapidly increasing number of genomes that can be compared simultaneously, calls for efficient software tools as brute-force approaches with quadratic memory requirements become infeasible in practise. The rapid pace at which new data become available, furthermore, makes it desirable to compute genome-wide orthology relations for a given dataset rather than relying on relations listed in databases.

RESULTS: The program Proteinortho described here is a stand-alone tool that is geared towards large datasets and makes use of distributed computing techniques when run on multi-core hardware. It implements an extended version of the reciprocal best alignment heuristic. We apply Proteinortho to compute orthologous proteins in the complete set of all 717 eubacterial genomes available at NCBI at the beginning of 2009. We identified thirty proteins present in 99{\%} of all bacterial proteomes.

CONCLUSIONS: Proteinortho significantly reduces the required amount of memory for orthology analysis compared to existing tools, allowing such computations to be performed on off-the-shelf hardware.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS7 gene was cloned by its location immediately downstream of the previously isolated and characterized ARO4 gene. The two genes have the same orientation with a distance of only 416 bp between the two open reading frames. The yeast HIS7 gene represents the first isolated eukaryotic gene encoding the enzymatic activities which catalyze the fifth and sixth step in histidine biosynthesis. The open reading frame of the HIS7 gene has a length of 1,656 bp resulting in a gene product of 552 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 61,082. Two findings implicate a bifunctional nature of the HIS7 gene product. First, the N-terminal and C-terminal segments of the deduced HIS7 amino acid sequence show significant homology to prokaryotic monofunctional glutamine amidotransferases and cyclases, respectively, involved in histidine biosynthesis. Second, the yeast HIS7 gene is able to suppress His auxotrophy of corresponding Escherichia coli hisH and hisF mutants. HIS7 gene expression is regulated by the general control system of amino acid biosynthesis. GCN4-dependent and GCN4-independent (basal) transcription use different initiator elements in the HIS7 promoter.},

abstract = {Differentiation of cellular lineages is facilitated by asymmetric segregation of fate determinants between dividing cells. In budding yeast, various aging factors segregate to the aging (mother)-lineage, with poorly understood consequences. In this study, we show that yeast mother cells form a protein aggregate during early replicative aging that is maintained as a single, asymmetrically inherited deposit over the remaining lifespan. Surprisingly, deposit formation was not associated with stress or general decline in proteostasis. Rather, the deposit-containing cells displayed enhanced degradation of cytosolic proteasome substrates and unimpaired clearance of stress-induced protein aggregates. Deposit formation was dependent on Hsp42, which collected non-random client proteins of the Hsp104/Hsp70-refolding machinery, including the prion Sup35. Importantly, loss of Hsp42 resulted in symmetric inheritance of its constituents and prolonged the lifespan of the mother cell. Together, these data suggest that protein aggregation is an early aging-associated differentiation event in yeast, having a two-faceted role in organismal fitness.},

Analysis of two sets of deletions defined a 75-base-pair sequence, located ca. midway between the transcription initiation regions of GAL1 and GAL10, that mediates GAL4-dependent induction of both genes. Deletion of various parts of this sequence (called the GAL upstream activating sequence or UASG) reduced GAL1 and GAL10 induction about equally. Sequences in the GAL10-proximal half of UASG in some sequence contexts functioned independently of sequences in the GAL1-proximal half of UASG. A 33-base-pair deletion of the GAL10-proximal half of UASG drastically reduced induction. Deletions between UASG and the GAL1 TATA box caused beta-galactosidase to be synthesized at an unexpectedly high basal level, that is, in the absence of galactose and GAL4 product. Some of these mutations also reduced the repression caused by glucose.},

abstract = {The role of Hsp70 chaperones in yeast prion propagation is well established. Highly conserved Hsp90 chaperones participate in a number of cellular processes, such as client protein maturation, protein degradation, cellular signalling and apoptosis, but little is known about their role in propagation of infectious prion like aggregates. Here, we examine the influence of Hsp90 in the maintenance of yeast prion [URE3] which is a prion form of native protein Ure2, and reveal a previously unknown role of Hsp90 as an important regulator of [URE3] stability. We show that the C-terminal MEEVD pentapeptide motif, but not the client maturation activity of Hsp90, is essential for [URE3] prion stability. In testing deletions of various Hsp90 co-chaperones known to bind this motif, we find the immunophilin homolog Cpr7 is essential for [URE3] propagation. We show that Cpr7 interacts with Ure2 and enhances its fibrillation. The requirement of Cpr7 is specific for [URE3] as its deletion does not antagonize both strong and weak variant of another yeast prion [PSI+], suggesting a distinct role of the Hsp90 co-chaperone with different yeast prions. Our data show that, similar to the Hsp70 family, the Hsp90 chaperones also influence yeast prion maintenance, and that immunophilins could regulate protein multimerization independently of their activity as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases.},

abstract = {Amyloid propagation requires high levels of sequence specificity so that only molecules with very high sequence identity can form cross-$\beta$-sheet structures of sufficient stringency for incorporation into the amyloid fibril. This sequence specificity presents a barrier to transmission of prions between two species with divergent sequences, termed a species barrier. Here, we study the relative effects of protein sequence, seed conformation and environment on the species barrier strength and specificity for the yeast prion protein, Sup35p, from three closely related species of the Saccharomyces senso stricto group, namely S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus and S. paradoxus. Through in vivo plasmid shuffle experiments we show that the major characteristics of the transmission barrier and conformational fidelity are determined by the protein sequence rather than cellular environment. In vitro data confirm that kinetics and structural preferences of aggregation of the S. paradoxus and S. bayanus proteins are influenced by anions in accordance to their positions in the Hofmeister series, as previously observed for S. cerevisiae. However, the specificity of the species barrier is primarily affected by the sequence and the type of anion present during the formation of the initial seed, while anions present during the seeded aggregation process typically influence kinetics rather than the specificity of prion conversion. Thus, our work shows that the protein sequence and the conformation variant (strain) of prion seed are the primary determinants of cross-species prion specificity both in vivo and in vitro.},

abstract = {In recent years, proteomic data have contributed to genome annotation efforts, most notably in humans and mice, and spawned a field termed "proteogenomics". Yeast, in contrast with higher eukaryotes, has a small genome, which has lent itself to simpler ORF prediction. Despite this, continual advances in mass spectrometry suggest that proteomics should be able to improve genome annotation even in this well-characterized species. Here we applied a proteogenomics workflow to yeast to identify novel protein-coding genes. Specific databases were generated, from intergenic regions of the genome, which were then queried with MS/MS data. This suggested the existence of several putative novel ORFs of <100 codons, one of which we chose to validate. Synthetic peptides, RNA-Seq analysis, and evidence of evolutionary conservation allowed for the unequivocal definition of a new protein of 78 amino acids encoded on chromosome X, which we dub YJR107C-A. It encodes a new type of domain, which ab initio modeling suggests as predominantly $\alpha$-helical. We show that this gene is nonessential for growth; however, deletion increases sensitivity to osmotic stress. Finally, from the above discovery process, we discuss a generalizable strategy for the identification of short ORFs and small proteins, many of which are likely to be undiscovered.},

abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can harbor a number of distinct prions. Most of the yeast prion proteins contain a glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) rich region that drives prion formation. Prion-like domains, defined as regions with high compositional similarity to yeast prion domains, are common in eukaryotic proteomes, and mutations in various human proteins containing prion-like domains have been linked to degenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we discuss a recent study in which we utilized two strategies to generate prion activity in non-prion Q/N-rich domains. First, we made targeted mutations in four non-prion Q/N-rich domains, replacing predicted prion-inhibiting amino acids with prion-promoting amino acids. All four mutants formed foci when expressed in yeast, and two acquired bona fide prion activity. Prion activity could be generated with as few as two mutations, suggesting that many non-prion Q/N-rich proteins may be just a small number of mutations from acquiring aggregation or prion activity. Second, we created tandem repeats of short prion-prone segments, and observed length-dependent prion activity. These studies demonstrate the considerable progress that has been made in understanding the sequence basis for aggregation of prion and prion-like domains, and suggest possible mechanisms by which new prion domains could evolve.},

abstract = {Tolerance to high levels of ethanol is an ecologically and industrially relevant phenotype of microbes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex trait remain largely unknown. Here, we use long-term experimental evolution of isogenic yeast populations of different initial ploidy to study adaptation to increasing levels of ethanol. Whole-genome sequencing of more than 30 evolved populations and over 100 adapted clones isolated throughout this two-year evolution experiment revealed how a complex interplay of de novo single nucleotide mutations, copy number variation, ploidy changes, mutator phenotypes, and clonal interference led to a significant increase in ethanol tolerance. Although the specific mutations differ between different evolved lineages, application of a novel computational pipeline, PheNetic, revealed that many mutations target functional modules involved in stress response, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and respiration. Measuring the fitness effects of selected mutations introduced in non-evolved ethanol-sensitive cells revealed several adaptive mutations that had previously not been implicated in ethanol tolerance, including mutations in PRT1, VPS70 and MEX67. Interestingly, variation in VPS70 was recently identified as a QTL for ethanol tolerance in an industrial bio-ethanol strain. Taken together, our results show how, in contrast to adaptation to some other stresses, adaptation to a continuous complex and severe stress involves interplay of different evolutionary mechanisms. In addition, our study reveals functional modules involved in ethanol resistance and identifies several mutations that could help to improve the ethanol tolerance of industrial yeasts.},

abstract = {The yeast Cyc8p-Tup1p complex is known to serve primarily as a transcriptional corepressor in a variety of biological processes. However, less is known about its function as a coactivator. Herein, we found tryptophan transporter genes, TAT1 and TAT2, that, when overexpressed, suppressed the slow growth of $\Delta$cyc8. We observed that the addition of tryptophan to $\Delta$cyc8 cultures partially restored cell growth, and the deletion of CYC8 and TUP1 reduced transcriptional levels of TAT1 and TAT2. Tup1p bound to the promoter region of TAT1 and TAT2 genes that were dependent on STP1 and STP2 (encoding DNA-binding activator proteins) for expression. Similarly, transcription of the other Stp1/2p-dependent amino acid transporter (AAT) genes also required CYC8 and TUP1 gene functions. These data indicate that Cyc8p-Tup1p plays a role as a transcriptional coactivator for AAT genes via Stp1/2p activators and that lowering intracellular tryptophan by CYC8 deletion causes slow growth.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty.

RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

annote = {Терминация трансляции у эукариот начинается, когда комплекс eRF1-eRF3-GTP связывается со стоп-кодоном в A-сайте рибосомы. Гидролиз ГТФ белком eRF3 индукцирует изменение его конформации и последующую диссоциацию, что позволяет eRF1 расположиться в A-сайте. Считается, что это изменение приводит к тому, что GGQ становится ближе к эфирной связи между синтезированным полипептидом и тРНК, стимулируя гидролиз этой связи. Вместе с этим (?) ABCE1 после диссоциации eRF3 привлекается к рибосоме и вместе с eRF1 катализирует разделение субъединиц и их рециклирование.

        

        
Мы предположили, что неактивный мутант eRF1 может блокировать работу комплекса терминации (до гидролиза) двумя путями. Во-первых, eRF1 будет в комплексе со стоп-кодоном, который он узнал. Во-вторых, застрявший полипептид будет уникальным якорем, позволяющим вытащить именно такие комплексы для структурного анализа. 
Таким образом, они заменили GGQ и AAQ и использовали такой мутантный белок в системе трансляции in vitro. Освобождение пептида на всех 3 стоп-кодонах ингибировалось в пристутствии этого мутанта, что определяли по присутствию пептидил-тРНК (S1a, 1b). Аффинная очистка этих комплексов (а вытягивали их за белок) позволила зарегистрировать как eRF1(AAQ) и ABCE1, что позволяет предположить, что в этих комплексах eRF1 уже расположен полностью в A-сайте. Ассоциация ABCE1 улучшалась в таких комплексах по сравнению с комплексами, в которых была обрубленная мРНК (S1c), что подтверждает литературные данные о том, что функция ABCE1 в рециклировании требует гидролиза пептидил-тРНК.

        

        
Очищенные комплексы с каждым из 3 стоп-кодонов (S1d) были использованы для крио-ЭМ. S2: многочисленные раунды классификации in silico ={\&}gt; {\~{}}10{\%} содержат eRF1(AAQ)-ABCE1.

        

        
Для каждого кодона исследовали от 20 до 50 тысяч частиц и получили карты с разрешением окло 3.5 ангстремов. 1, S3, ST1.
        

        

        
          
1a: в каждой реконструкции eRF1 в разложенной конформации, а ABCE1 в ГТФазном центре. Относительно кристалла домены eRF1 изменили расположение (S4a) и хорошо разрешены (3b). 
        
Непосредственное взаимодействие N-домена с кодоном в decoding centre противоречит высказанному ранее предположению о том, что eRF1 отваливается от стоп-кодона в присутствии ABCE1. 
          
1b: N- и M-домены eRF1 независимо связываются с тРНК в P-сайте и вместе напоминают тРНК в A-сайте. Вторая альфа-спираль N-домена идёт параллельно и взаимодействует с антикодоновым стеблем и петлей тРНК в P-сайте (S4b).
N domain but P-site
          
S4c M-домен выполняет роль акцепторного стебля тРНК и помогает мотиву GGQ расположиться в пептидилтрансферазном центре. Для того чтобы расположиться похоже на 3{\&}{\#}039;-край тРНК в A-сайте, GGQ сдвигается на 10 ангстрем по сравнению с кристаллической структурой. 
В этом случае остатки аланина располагаются ровно напротив концевого аденозина в тРНКв P-сайте и Gln185, близко к эфирной связи между полипептидом и тРНК. Это напоминает ситуацию в проанализированном ранее бактериальном комплексе. 
          
2b + S5: В центре декодинга взаимодействие между N-доменом eRF1 и стоп-кодоном видны хорошо. Больше всего удивляет компактная конформация мРНК, которая занимает не 3, а 4 нуклеотида (3a, b). Эта структура мРНК зависит от выпетливания A1825 (44 петля 18s), который взаимодействует с +2 стоп-кодона, а там заякоривается +3. Это позволяет +4 взаимодейстовать с G626. Возможно, именно поэтому в +4 предпочтительней пурины.

        

        
          
3c: а у бактерий по-другому. A1492, а не A1493, и дальше взаимодействия тоже другие.

        

        
          
4a NIKS, YxCxxxF и GTS сшили со стоп-кодном. NIKS (конец второй альфа-спирали) требует уридина в +1. 

        

        
          
6.

        

        
          
4b,c: вз-е YxCxxF и Glu55 с +2 и +3 позволяет отличать стоп от смыслового.

We present an algorithm (mrFAST) to comprehensively map next-generation sequence reads, which allows for the prediction of absolute copy-number variation of duplicated segments and genes. We examine three human genomes and experimentally validate genome-wide copy number differences. We estimate that, on average, 73-87 genes vary in copy number between any two individuals and find that these genic differences overwhelmingly correspond to segmental duplications (odds ratio = 135; P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). Our method can distinguish between different copies of highly identical genes, providing a more accurate assessment of gene content and insight into functional constraint without the limitations of array-based technology.},

abstract = {Dysfunction of protein quality control contributes to the cellular pathology of polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with aggregate deposition. Here we analyzed how polyQ aggregation interferes with the clearance of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We show in a yeast model that polyQ-expanded proteins inhibit the UPS-mediated degradation of misfolded cytosolic carboxypeptidase Y(∗) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CG(∗)) without blocking ubiquitylation or proteasome function. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the polyQ aggregates sequester the low-abundant and essential Hsp40 chaperone Sis1p. Overexpression of Sis1p restores CG(∗) degradation. Surprisingly, we find that Sis1p, and its homolog DnaJB1 in mammalian cells, mediates the delivery of misfolded proteins into the nucleus for proteasomal degradation. Sis1p shuttles between cytosol and nucleus, and its cellular level limits the capacity of this quality control pathway. Upon depletion of Sis1p by polyQ aggregation, misfolded proteins are barred from entering the nucleus and form cytoplasmic inclusions.},

1A. Описание системы (мутантная карбоксипептидаза Y без сигнальной послдеовательности, сшитая с GFP). Этот белок не способен сворачиваться в цитозоле и отправляется в протеасому, причём этот процесс зависит от Hps70 (Ssa1) и Hsp40 (Ydj1). Эта деградация проходит (по крайней мере частично) в ядре. 
Система: GAL1-20/96Q + PRC1-CG*

        

        
1B + S1A. 9h индукции ={\&}gt; агрегаты (PAGE, filter trap)
S1A: а если коэкспрессировать, Q96 больше накапливается.

        

        
1C: CHX ={\&}gt; оценка скорости деградации ={\&}gt; после 6h Q96 CG* деградирует хорошо
А после 15h плохо

        

        
S1B: а если коэкспрессировать другой polyQ-белок, то происходит то же самое ={\&}gt; значит, дело не в хантингтине

        

        
1D: а коагрегируют ли они? Теперь оба под GAL1-промотором, а Q96 с mCherry. Работает так же, но фокусы не перекрываются. Кроме того, S1A вообще не в агрегатах. С AT3c71Q примерно то же самое.

        

        
Ни один из этих белков по отдельности не вредит здоровью дрожжевой клетки. Однако если коэкспрессировать с 96Q, даже небольшой уровень CG* неполезен.

        

        
2A. Что всё-таки происходит и на каком этапе? Может быть до протеасомы (взаимодействие с шаперонами), может быть уже там. Может быть в обоих местах сразу.

        

        
2B. Попробовали занять протеасому чем-то ещё. GFP + дегрон из орнитин декарбоксилазы. Эта штука одинаково хорошо деградирует без 96Q и с 96Q, хотя во втором случае деградация CG* нарушена.
S2A + 2C: 96QcODC эффективно деградирует
и при этом деградация CG* улучшается.
При этом 96Q с мутантным дегроном стабильнее и мешает деградации CG*
Вывод из картинки 2: исключаем прямое ингибирование протеасомы

        

        
Теперь перемещаемся на уровень выше. А что с убиквитинированием?
S2B + S2C: контроли к эксперименту к His6-Ub (что действительно есть деградация CG*)

        

        
Figure 2D: убиквинируется во всех случаях.

        

        
Figure S2D: а если ещё задрать убиквитинирование? Сверхэкспрессия Ubr1p не помогает.

        

        
Значит, 96Q что-то на себя титрует. А что?

        

        
Сравнили интерактомы 96QmCh (вытащенного с помощью анти-myc). центрифугировали, смешали, DIGE. {\~{}}100 белков хотя бы в 2 раза хотя бы в 2 из 3 экспериментов (Table S1)
Там несколько Q/N-богатых белков и несколько известных прионов. 

        

        
Figure 3A: больше всего из интерактома их заинтересовали шапероны и белки протеасомы. 
Из протеасомы: Dsk2, но из литературы известно, что он не имеет отношения к деградации CG*, а у них даже увеличивал скорость деградации (но данные не показаны)
Из шаперонов: 30x Sis1p

        

        
3B: экспрессировали Sis1 + VN (N-кусок Venus), 96/20Q + VC и смотрели флуоресценцию Venus.
S3A: фракционирование лизатов ={\&}gt; в 96Q больше Sis1 в осадке.
pull-down: примерно половина Sis1p ассоциировала с растворимым 96Q, в том числе с олигомерами
S3B {\&}amp; C: с AT3c71Q то же самое.

        

        
S3E + S3G Сверхэкспрессия Ydj1, Ssa1, Hsp42 не восстанавливает нормальную деградацию CG*
3E + S3F Совсем наоборот: сверхэкспрессия Ydj1 приводила к увеличению растворимости CG* и Q96 и диффузному распределению CG*
3E + S3G Более того, сверхэкспрессия Ydj1 и Ssa1 задерживала деградацию CG* даже в 20Q. 

        

        
S3H: сверхэкспрессия Sis1 работает как надо

        

        
={\&}gt; Sis1 обладает какой-то очень специфичной функцией

        

        
В нормальных клетках (без polyQ)
4A: tet-SIS1: 75{\%} уровня. 
И даже этого достаточно для того, чтобы задерживать деградацию CG* сравнимо с 96Q)
15{\%} уровня (+DOX) уже особо не меняют ситуацию.
S4A: Дело не в убиквитинировании CG*

        

        
={\&}gt; Sis1 лимитирует скорость реакции, причём уже после убиквитинирования.

        

        
А Hsp70 здесь участвуют?
Для этого нужен HPD-loop
Сделали Sis1AAA или Sis1deltaJ

        

        
4B: замена Sis1 Sis1AAA мешает правильной деградации CG* (они формируют включения в цитоплазме)

        

        
4C: все формируют комплекс с Ssa1 и CG* (потому что за их HA-хвост можно вытащить) 

        

        
4D: Может быть, Sis1 вообще участвует в деградации белков цитозоле? Проверили фруктозо-1,6-бисфосфатазу, которая деградирует при добавлении глюкозы. Кинетика похожая при разном количестве Sis1. 
Нет, не похоже.

        

        
S4B: UbG76V-GFP примерно то же самое.

        

        
Значит, Sis1 нужен очень выборочно.

        

        
В ядре 70-80{\%} протеасом. Одна из стратегий контроля качества белков -- доставить плохие белки в ядро.
Для CG* такая стратегия уже была показана

        

        
5A, S5A: при уменьшении количества Sis1 CG* собирается в цитоплазме. 
Кроме того, 5B: NLS способствовал деградации, а NES стабилизировал CG*

        

        
5C в клетках pdr5delta (едят MG132) и при наличии MG132 CG* аккумулируется около ядра и распределяется по ядру, а Sis1p обитает исключительно в ядре.

        

        
5D: примерно то же самое происходит при делеции San1p, работающей в параллель с Ubr1. При этом влияние на деградацию CG* было меньше (литературные данные), и это хорошо сочеталось с тем, что не весь Sis1 уходил в ядро. 
S5B: даже без CG* Sis1 немного уходит в ядро.

        

        
А что будет, если запретить Sis1 гулять между ядром и цитоплазмой? 
5E Сделали версии с NLS и NES. Оба не способны помогать деградации CG*.
S5C: более того, в случае с NES CG* даже стабилизировался (возможно, из-за смешанных димеров).

        

        
S5D: у Sis1 нет очевидного NLS, его туда приводит Srp1. Если немного сломать Srp1, CG* стабилизируется.

S6A В цитозоле
S6B быстро (2h) деградирует в присутствии CHX
S6A {\&}amp; C: ингибирование протеасомы приводит к накоплению в ядре и около

        

        
S6B: частичное ингибирование DnaJB1 (одного из гомологов Sis1) замедляет деградацию

abstract = {Kinetochores are conserved protein complexes that bind the replicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and then direct their segregation. To better comprehend Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochore function, we dissected the phospho-regulated dynamic interaction between conserved kinetochore protein Cnn1(CENP-T), the centromere region, and the Ndc80 complex through the cell cycle. Cnn1 localizes to kinetochores at basal levels from G1 through metaphase but accumulates abruptly at anaphase onset. How Cnn1 is recruited and which activities regulate its dynamic localization are unclear. We show that Cnn1 harbors two kinetochore-localization activities: a C-terminal histone-fold domain (HFD) that associates with the centromere region and a N-terminal Spc24/Spc25 interaction sequence that mediates linkage to the microtubule-binding Ndc80 complex. We demonstrate that the established Ndc80 binding site in the N terminus of Cnn1, Cnn1(60-84), should be extended with flanking residues, Cnn1(25-91), to allow near maximal binding affinity to Ndc80. Cnn1 localization was proposed to depend on Mps1 kinase activity at Cnn1-S74, based on in vitro experiments demonstrating the Cnn1-Ndc80 complex interaction. We demonstrate that from G1 through metaphase, Cnn1 localizes via both its HFD and N-terminal Spc24/Spc25 interaction sequence, and deletion or mutation of either region results in anomalous Cnn1 kinetochore levels. At anaphase onset (when Mps1 activity decreases) Cnn1 becomes enriched mainly via the N-terminal Spc24/Spc25 interaction sequence. In sum, we provide the first in vivo evidence of Cnn1 preanaphase linkages with the kinetochore and enrichment of the linkages during anaphase.},

abstract = {Current techniques for identifying mutations that convey a small increased cancer risk or those that modify cancer risk in carriers of highly penetrant mutations are limited by the statistical power of epidemiologic studies, which require screening of large populations and candidate genes. To identify dosage-sensitive genes that mediate genomic stability, we performed a genomewide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for heterozygous mutations that increase chromosome instability in a checkpoint-deficient diploid strain. We used two genome stability assays sensitive enough to detect the impact of heterozygous mutations and identified 172 heterozygous gene disruptions that affected chromosome fragment (CF) loss, 45{\%} of which also conferred modest but statistically significant instability of endogenous chromosomes. Analysis of heterozygous deletion of 65 of these genes demonstrated that the majority increased genomic instability in both checkpoint-deficient and wild-type backgrounds. Strains heterozygous for COMA kinetochore complex genes were particularly unstable. Over 50{\%} of the genes identified in this screen have putative human homologs, including CHEK2, ERCC4, and TOPBP1, which are already associated with inherited cancer susceptibility. These findings encourage the incorporation of this orthologous gene list into cancer epidemiology studies and suggest further analysis of heterozygous phenotypes in yeast as models of human disease resulting from haplo-insufficiency.},

abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) causes accelerated transcript degradation when a premature translation termination codon disrupts the open reading frame (ORF). Although endogenous transcripts that have uninterrupted ORFs are typically insensitive to NMD, some can nonetheless become prone to NMD when translation terminates at out-of-frame premature stop codons. This occurs when introns containing stop codons fail to be spliced, when translation of an upstream ORF (uORF) terminates in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) or the coding region, or when the 5'-proximal AUG initiation codon is bypassed and translation initiates at a downstream out-of-frame AUG followed by a stop codon. Some 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) are also known to trigger NMD, but the mechanism is less well understood. To further study the role of 3'-UTRs in NMD, a reporter system was designed to examine 3'-UTRs from candidate genes known to produce NMD-sensitive transcripts. Out of eight that were tested, the 3'-UTRs from MSH4 and SPO16 caused NMD-dependent mRNA destabilization. Both endogenous genes produce multiple transcripts that differ in length at the 3' end. Detailed studies revealed that the longest of six reporter MSH4-3'-UTR transcripts was NMD-sensitive but five shorter transcripts were insensitive. NMD-dependent degradation of the long transcript required Xrn1, which degrades mRNA from the 5' end. Sensitivity to NMD was not associated with extensive translational read-through past the normal stop codon. To our knowledge, this is the first example where multiple transcripts containing the same ORF are differentially sensitive to NMD in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results provide a proof of principle that long 3'-UTRs can trigger NMD, which suggests a potential link between errors in transcription termination or processing and mRNA decay.},

abstract = {Genome-wide studies of steady-state mRNA levels revealed common principles underlying transcriptional changes in response to external stimuli. To uncover principles that govern other stages of the gene-expression response, we analyzed the translational response and its coordination with transcriptome changes following exposure to severe stress. Yeast cells were grown for 1 h in medium containing 1 M NaCl, which elicits a maximal but transient translation inhibition, and nonpolysomal or polysomal mRNA pools were subjected to DNA-microarray analyses. We observed a strong repression in polysomal association for most mRNAs, with no simple correlation with the changes in transcript levels. This led to an apparent accumulation of many mRNAs as a nontranslating pool, presumably waiting for recovery from the stress. However, some mRNAs demonstrated a correlated change in their polysomal association and their transcript levels (i.e., potentiation). This group was enriched with targets of the transcription factors Msn2/Msn4, and the translational induction of several tested mRNAs was diminished in an Msn2/Msn4 deletion strain. Genome-wide analysis of a strain lacking the high salinity response kinase Hog1p revealed that the group of translationally affected genes is significantly enriched with motifs that were shown to be associated with the ARE-binding protein Pub1. Since a relatively small number of genes was affected by Hog1p deletion, additional signaling pathways are likely to be involved in coordinating the translational response to severe salinity stress.},

To identify mechanisms of TF diversification, we performed detailed comparisons of yeast C2H2 ZF proteins with identical canonical recognition residues that are expected to bind the same DNA sequences. Unexpectedly, we found that ZF proteins can adapt to recognize new binding sites in a modular fashion whereby binding to common core sites remains unaffected. We identified two distinct mechanisms, conserved across multiple Ascomycota species, by which this molecular adaptation occurred. Our results suggest a route for TF evolution that alleviates negative pleiotropic effects by modularly gaining new binding sites. These findings expand our current understanding of ZF DNA binding and provide evidence for paralogous ZFs utilizing alternate modes of DNA binding to recognize unique sets of noncanonical binding sites.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model system to investigate the mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing but only a few examples of alternative splice site usage have been described in this organism. Using RNA-Seq analysis of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) mutant strains, we show that many S. cerevisiae intron-containing genes exhibit usage of alternative splice sites, but many transcripts generated by splicing at these sites are non-functional because they introduce premature termination codons, leading to degradation by NMD. Analysis of splicing mutants combined with NMD inactivation revealed the role of specific splicing factors in governing the use of these alternative splice sites and identified novel functions for Prp17p in enhancing the use of branchpoint-proximal upstream 3' splice sites and for Prp18p in suppressing the usage of a non-canonical AUG 3'-splice site in GCR1. The use of non-productive alternative splice sites can be increased in stress conditions in a promoter-dependent manner, contributing to the down-regulation of genes during stress. These results show that alternative splicing is frequent in S. cerevisiae but masked by RNA degradation and that the use of alternative splice sites in this organism is mostly aimed at controlling transcript levels rather than increasing proteome diversity.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparing genomes of individual organisms using next-generation sequencing data is, until now, mostly performed using a reference genome. This is challenging when the reference is distant and introduces bias towards the exact sequence present in the reference. Recent improvements in both sequencing read length and efficiency of assembly algorithms have brought direct comparison of individual genomes by de novo assembly, rather than through a reference genome, within reach.

RESULTS: Here, we develop and test an algorithm, named Magnolya, that uses a Poisson mixture model for copy number estimation of contigs assembled from sequencing data. We combine this with co-assembly to allow de novo detection of copy number variation (CNV) between two individual genomes, without mapping reads to a reference genome. In co-assembly, multiple sequencing samples are combined, generating a single contig graph with different traversal counts for the nodes and edges between the samples. In the resulting 'coloured' graph, the contigs have integer copy numbers; this negates the need to segment genomic regions based on depth of coverage, as required for mapping-based detection methods. Magnolya is then used to assign integer copy numbers to contigs, after which CNV probabilities are easily inferred. The copy number estimator and CNV detector perform well on simulated data. Application of the algorithms to hybrid yeast genomes showed allotriploid content from different origin in the wine yeast Y12, and extensive CNV in aneuploid brewing yeast genomes. Integer CNV was also accurately detected in a short-term laboratory-evolved yeast strain.},

abstract = {Prions consist of misfolded proteins that have adopted an infectious amyloid conformation. In vivo, prion biogenesis is intimately associated with the protein quality control machinery. Using electron tomography, we probed the effects of the heat shock protein Hsp70 chaperone system on the structure of a model yeast [PSI+] prion in situ. Individual Hsp70 deletions shift the balance between fibril assembly and disassembly, resulting in a variable shell of nonfibrillar, but still immobile, aggregates at the surface of the [PSI+] prion deposits. Both Hsp104 (an Hsp100 disaggregase) and Sse1 (the major yeast form of Hsp110) were localized to this surface shell of [PSI+] deposits in the deletion mutants. Elevation of Hsp104 expression promoted the appearance of this novel, nonfibrillar form of the prion aggregate. Moreover, Sse1 was found to regulate prion fibril length. Our studies reveal a key role for Sse1 (Hsp110), in cooperation with Hsp104, in regulating the length and assembly state of [PSI+] prion fibrils in vivo.},

abstract = {Three benchtop high-throughput sequencing instruments are now available. The 454 GS Junior (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies) are laser-printer sized and offer modest set-up and running costs. Each instrument can generate data required for a draft bacterial genome sequence in days, making them attractive for identifying and characterizing pathogens in the clinical setting. We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli O104:H4, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The MiSeq had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 GS Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent PGM had the highest throughput (80–100 Mb/h). Unlike the MiSeq, the Ion Torrent PGM and 454 GS Junior both produced homopolymer-associated indel errors (1.5 and 0.38 errors per 100 bases, respectively).},

abstract = {The G + C content at synonymous codon positions (GC3s) in genes varies along chromosomes in most eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, regions of high GC3s are correlated with recombination hot spots, probably due to biased gene conversion. Here we examined how GC3s differs among groups of related yeast species in the Saccharomyces and Candida clades. The chromosomal locations of GC3s peaks and troughs are conserved among four Saccharomyces species, but we find that there have been highly consistent small shifts in their GC3s values. For instance, 84{\%} of all S. cerevisiae genes have a lower GC3s value than their S. bayanus orthologs. There are extensive interspecies differences in the Candida clade both in the median value of GC3s (ranging from 22{\%} to 49{\%}) and in the variance of GC3s among genes. In three species--Candida lusitaniae, Pichia stipitis, and Yarrowia lipolytica--there is one region on each chromosome in which GC3s is markedly reduced. We propose that these GC-poor troughs indicate the positions of centromeres because in Y. lipolytica they coincide with the five experimentally identified centromeres. In P. stipitis, the troughs contain clusters of the retrotransposon Tps5. Likewise, in Debaryomyces hansenii, there is one cluster of the retrotransposon Tdh5 per chromosome, and all these clusters are located in GC-poor troughs. Locally reduced G + C content around centromeres is consistent with a model in which G + C content correlates with recombination rate, and recombination is suppressed around centromeres, although the troughs are unexpectedly wide (100-300 kb).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies. RESULTS: We present MAKER2, a genome annotation and data management tool designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded, parallelized application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes where training-data are limited, of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2 also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations, significantly improving their quality. We also show that MAKER2 can evaluate the quality of genome annotations, and identify and prioritize problematic annotations for manual review. CONCLUSIONS: MAKER2 is the first annotation engine specifically designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 scales to datasets of any size, requires little in the way of training data, and can use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality. It can also update and manage legacy genome annotation datasets.},

abstract = {The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) is a new sequencing platform that substantially differs from other sequencing technologies by measuring pH rather than light to detect polymerisation events. Using re-sequencing datasets, we comprehensively characterise the biases and errors introduced by the PGM at both the base and flow level, across a combination of factors, including chip density, sequencing kit, template species and machine. We found two distinct insertion/deletion (indel) error types that accounted for the majority of errors introduced by the PGM. The main error source was inaccurate flow-calls, which introduced indels at a raw rate of 2.84{\%} (1.38{\%} after quality clipping) using the OneTouch 200 bp kit. Inaccurate flow-calls typically resulted in over-called short-homopolymers and under-called long-homopolymers. Flow-call accuracy decreased with consecutive flow cycles, but we also found significant periodic fluctuations in the flow error-rate, corresponding to specific positions within the flow-cycle pattern. Another less common PGM error, high frequency indel (HFI) errors, are indels that occur at very high frequency in the reads relative to a given base position in the reference genome, but in the majority of instances were not replicated consistently across separate runs. HFI errors occur approximately once every thousand bases in the reference, and correspond to 0.06{\%} of bases in reads. Currently, the PGM does not achieve the accuracy of competing light-based technologies. However, flow-call inaccuracy is systematic and the statistical models of flow-values developed here will enable PGM-specific bioinformatics approaches to be developed, which will account for these errors. HFI errors may prove more challenging to address, especially for polymorphism and amplicon applications, but may be overcome by sequencing the same DNA template across multiple chips.},

abstract = {Gene overexpression beyond a permissible limit causes defects in cellular functions. However, the permissible limits of most genes are unclear. Previously, we developed a genetic method designated genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) to measure the copy number limit of overexpression of a target gene. In the current study, we applied gTOW to the analysis of all protein-coding genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that the yeast cellular system was robust against an increase in the copy number by up to 100 copies in >80{\%} of the genes. After frameshift and segmentation analyses, we isolated 115 dosage-sensitive genes (DSGs) with copy number limits of 10 or less. DSGs contained a significant number of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport. DSGs tended to be highly expressed and to encode protein complex members. We demonstrated that the protein burden caused the dosage sensitivity of highly expressed genes using a gTOW experiment in which the open reading frame was replaced with GFP. Dosage sensitivities of some DSGs were rescued by the simultaneous increase in the copy numbers of partner genes, indicating that stoichiometric imbalances among complexes cause dosage sensitivity. The results obtained in this study will provide basic knowledge about the physiology of chromosomal abnormalities and the evolution of chromosomal composition.},

abstract = {The origin of the nucleus at the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition represents one of the most important events in the evolution of cellular organization. The nuclear envelope encircles the chromosomes in interphase and is a selectively permeable barrier between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm and an organizational scaffold for the nucleus. It remains intact in the 'closed' mitosis of some yeasts, but loses its integrity in the 'open' mitosis of mammals. Instances of both types of mitosis within two evolutionary clades indicate multiple evolutionary transitions between open and closed mitosis, although the underlying genetic changes that influenced these transitions remain unknown. A survey of the diversity of mitotic nuclei that fall between these extremes is the starting point from which to determine the physiologically relevant characteristics distinguishing open from closed mitosis and to understand how they evolved and why they are retained in present-day organisms. The field is now poised to begin addressing these issues by defining and documenting patterns of mitotic nuclear variation within and among species and mapping them onto a phylogenic tree. Deciphering the evolutionary history of open and closed mitosis will complement cell biological and genetic approaches aimed at deciphering the fundamental organizational principles of the nucleus.},

Today, novel yeast genomes are entirely sequenced for a variety of reasons, often only to identify a few expected genes of specific interest, thus providing a wealth of data, heterogenous in quality and completion but informative about the origin and evolution of this heterogeneous collection of unicellular modern fungi. However, how many scientists fully appreciate the important conceptual and technological roles played by yeasts in the extraordinary development of today's genomics? Novel notions of general significance emerged from the very first eukaryote sequenced, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and were successively refined and extended over time. Tools with general applications were originally developed with this yeast; and surprises emerged from the results.

abstract = {As one of the few known species in an active phase of intron proliferation, the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex is an especially attractive system for interrogating the gain and loss of introns in natural populations. In this study, we used a comparative population-genomic approach to identify and characterize 90 recently gained introns in this species. Molecular clock analyses indicate that these introns arose between 3.9 × 10(5) and 1.45 × 10(4) years ago, with a spike in intron proliferation approximately 5.2 × 10(4) to 1.22 × 10(5) years ago. Parallel gains at homologous positions contribute to 47.8{\%} (43/90) of discovered new introns. A disproportionally large number of new introns were found in historically isolated populations in Oregon. Nonetheless, derived, intron-bearing alleles were also identified in a wide range of geographic locations, suggesting intron gain and, to a lesser degree, intron loss are important sources of genetic variation in natural populations of Daphnia. A majority (55/90 or 61.1{\%}) of the identified neointrons have associated internal direct repeats with lengths and compositions that are unlikely to occur by chance, suggesting repeated bouts of staggered double-strand breaks (DSBs) during their evolution. Accordingly, internal, staggered DSBs may contribute to a passive trend toward increased length and sequence diversity in nascent introns.},

The strains originated from different geographical and ecological niches (Malaysian, West African, North American, Wine/European and Sake) and represent clean, non-mosaic lineages of S. cerevisiae, meaning that their genomes differ essentially by monomorphic and private SNPs. In this study, one representative strain for each of the five S. cerevisiae clean lineages was selected and mutated for several auxotroph genes by clean markerless deletions, so that all dominant markers remained available for further genetic manipulations. A set of 50 strains was assembled, including eight haploid and two diploid strains for each lineage. These strains carry different combinations of leu2∆0, lys2∆0, met15∆0, ura3∆0 and/or ura3∆::KanMX-barcoded deletions with marker configurations resembling that of the BY series, which will allow large-scale crossing with existing deletion collections.

abstract = {MOTIVATIONS: De novo sequencing of genomes is followed by annotation analyses aiming at identifying functional genomic features such as genes, non-coding RNAs or regulatory sequences, taking advantage of diverse datasets. These steps sometimes fail at detecting non-coding functional sequences: for example, origins of replication, centromeres and rDNA positions have proven difficult to annotate with high confidence. Here, we demonstrate an unconventional application of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technique, which typically aims at deciphering the average 3D organization of genomes, by showing how functional information about the sequence can be extracted solely from the chromosome contact map. RESULTS: Specifically, we describe a combined experimental and bioinformatic procedure that determines the genomic positions of centromeres and ribosomal DNA clusters in yeasts, including species where classical computational approaches fail. For instance, we determined the centromere positions in Naumovozyma castellii, where these coordinates could not be obtained previously. Although computed centromere positions were characterized by conserved synteny with neighboring species, no consensus sequences could be found, suggesting that centromeric binding proteins or mechanisms have significantly diverged. We also used our approach to refine centromere positions in Kuraishia capsulata and to identify rDNA positions in Debaryomyces hansenii. Our study demonstrates how 3C data can be used to complete the functional annotation of eukaryotic genomes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is provided in the Supplementary Material.

In contrast to a{\&}nbsp;well-established genome of brewer{\&}rsquo;s and wine yeast strains, the comprehensive evaluation of genomic features of distillery strains is lacking. In the present study, twenty two distillery yeast strains were subjected to electrophoretic karyotyping and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The strains analyzed were assigned to the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex and grouped into four species categories: S. bayanus , S. paradoxus , S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii . The genomic diversity was mainly revealed within subtelomeric regions and the losses and/or gains of fragments of chromosomes I, III, VI and IX were the most frequently observed. Statistically significant differences in the gene copy number were documented in six functional gene categories: 1) telomere maintenance via recombination, DNA helicase activity or DNA binding, 2) maltose metabolism process, glucose transmembrane transporter activity; 3) asparagine catabolism, cellular response to nitrogen starvation, localized in cell wall-bounded periplasmic space, 4) siderophore transport, 5) response to copper ion, cadmium ion binding and 6) L-iditol 2- dehydrogenase activity. The losses of YRF1 genes (Y{\&}rsquo; element ATP-dependent helicase) were accompanied by decreased level of Y{\&}rsquo; sequences and an increase in DNA double and single strand breaks, and oxidative DNA damage in the S. paradoxus group compared to the S. bayanus group. We postulate that naturally occurring diversity in the YRF1 gene copy number may promote genetic stability in the S. bayanus group of distillery yeast strains.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have transformed genomic research and have the potential to revolutionize clinical medicine. However, the background error rates of sequencing instruments and limitations in targeted read coverage have precluded the detection of rare DNA sequence variants by NGS. Here we describe a method, termed CypherSeq, which combines double-stranded barcoding error correction and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based target enrichment to vastly improve NGS-based rare variant detection. The CypherSeq methodology involves the ligation of sample DNA into circular vectors, which contain double-stranded barcodes for computational error correction and adapters for library preparation and sequencing. CypherSeq is capable of detecting rare mutations genome-wide as well as those within specific target genes via RCA-based enrichment. We demonstrate that CypherSeq is capable of correcting errors incurred during library preparation and sequencing to reproducibly detect mutations down to a frequency of 2.4 × 10(-7) per base pair, and report the frequency and spectra of spontaneous and ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.},

abstract = {The 137 ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) of Saccharomyces provide a model for gene coregulation. We examined the positional and functional organization of their regulators (Rap1 [repressor activator protein 1], Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1), the transcription machinery (TFIIB, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II), and chromatin at near-base-pair resolution using ChIP-exo, as RPGs are coordinately reprogrammed. Where Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 cross-linked broadly to promoter DNA in an RPG-specific manner and demarcated by general minor groove widening. Importantly, Hmo1 extended 20-50 base pairs (bp) downstream from Fhl1. Upon RPG repression, Fhl1 remained in place. Hmo1 dissociated, which was coupled to an upstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, as reflected by the Hmo1 extension and core promoter region. Fhl1 and Hmo1 may create two regulatable and positionally distinct barriers, against which chromatin remodelers position the +1 nucleosome into either an activating or a repressive state. Consistent with in vitro studies, we found that specific TFIID subunits, in addition to cross-linking at the core promoter, made precise cross-links at Rap1 sites, which we interpret to reflect native Rap1-TFIID interactions. Our findings suggest how sequence-specific DNA binding regulates nucleosome positioning and transcription complex assembly >300 bp away and how coregulation coevolved with coding sequences.},

@article{Singh2010,
abstract = {Gene duplication is integral to evolution, providing novel opportunities for organisms to diversify in function. One fundamental pathway of functional diversification among initially redundant gene copies, or paralogs, is via alterations in their expression patterns. Although the mechanisms underlying expression divergence are not completely understood, transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome occupancy are known to play a significant role in the process. Previous attempts to detect genomic variations mediating expression divergence in orthologs have had limited success for two primary reasons. First, it is inherently challenging to compare expressions among orthologs due to variable trans-acting effects and second, previous studies have quantified expression divergence in terms of an overall similarity of expression profiles across multiple samples, thereby obscuring condition-specific expression changes. Moreover, the inherently inter-correlated expressions among homologs present statistical challenges, not adequately addressed in many previous studies. Using rigorous statistical tests, here we characterize the relationship between cis element divergence and condition-specific expression divergence among paralogous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, among all combinations of gene family and TFs analyzed, we found a significant correlation between TF binding and the condition-specific expression patterns in over 20{\%} of the cases. In addition, incorporating nucleosome occupancy reveals several additional correlations. For instance, our results suggest that GAL4 binding plays a major role in the expression divergence of the genes in the sugar transporter family. Our work presents a novel means of investigating the cis regulatory changes potentially mediating expression divergence in paralogous gene families under specific conditions.},

abstract = {The question of the origin of life on Earth can largely be reduced to the question of what was the first molecular replicator system that was able to replicate and evolve under the presumably very harsh conditions on the early Earth. It is unlikely that a functional RNA could have existed under such conditions and it is generally assumed that some other kind of information system preceded the RNA world. Here, I present an informational molecular system that is stable, self-replicative, environmentally responsive, and evolvable under conditions characterized by high temperatures, ultraviolet and cosmic radiation. This postulated pregenetic system is based on the amyloid fold, a functionally unique polypeptide fold characterized by a cross beta-sheet structure in which the beta strands are arranged perpendicular to the fiber axis. Beside an extraordinary structural robustness, the amyloid fold posses a unique ability to transmit information by a three-dimensional templating mechanism. In amyloidogenesis short peptide monomers are added one by one to the growing end of the fiber. From the same monomeric subunits several structural variants of amyloid may be formed. Then, in a self-replicative mode, a specific amyloid conformer can act as a template and confer its spatially encoded information to daughter molecular entities in a repetitive way. In this process, the specific conformational information, the spatially changed organization, is transmitted; the coding element is the steric zipper structure, and recognition occurs by amino acid side chain complementarity. The amyloid information system fulfills several basic requirements of a primordial evolvable replicator system: (i) it is stable under the presumed primitive Earth conditions, (ii) the monomeric building blocks of the informational polymer can be formed from available prebiotic compounds, (iii) the system is self-assembling and self-replicative and (iv) it is adaptive to changes in the environment and evolvable.},

A central question is whether aneuploid phenotypes are the consequence of copy number changes of a few especially harmful genes that may be present on the extra chromosome or are caused by copy number alterations of many genes that confer no observable phenotype when varied individually. We used the proliferation defect exhibited by budding yeast strains carrying single additional chromosomes (disomes) to distinguish between the "few critical genes" hypothesis and the "mass action of genes" hypothesis. Our results indicate that subtle changes in gene dosage across a chromosome can have significant phenotypic consequences. We conclude that phenotypic thresholds can be crossed by mass action of copy number changes that, on their own, are benign.},

abstract = {Genetic instability is a hallmark of aneuploidy in budding and fission yeast. All aneuploid yeast strains analyzed to date harbor elevated levels of Rad52-GFP foci, a sign of DNA damage. Here we investigate how continuously elevated levels of DNA damage affect aneuploid cells. We show that Rad52-GFP foci form during S phase, consistent with the observation that DNA replication initiation and elongation are impaired in some aneuploid yeast strains. We furthermore find that although DNA damage is low in aneuploid cells, it nevertheless has dramatic consequences. Many aneuploid yeast strains adapt to DNA damage and undergo mitosis despite the presence of unrepaired DNA leading to cell death. Wild-type cells exposed to low levels of DNA damage exhibit a similar phenotype, indicating that adaptation to low levels of unrepaired DNA is a general property of the cell's response to DNA damage. Our results indicate that by causing low levels of DNA damage, whole-chromosome aneuploidies lead to DNA breaks that persist into mitosis. Such breaks provide the substrate for translocations and deletions that are a hallmark of cancer.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy causes severe developmental defects and is a near universal feature of tumor cells. Despite its profound effects, the cellular processes affected by aneuploidy are not well characterized. Here, we examined the consequences of aneuploidy on the proteome of aneuploid budding yeast strains. We show that although protein levels largely scale with gene copy number, subunits of multi-protein complexes are notable exceptions. Posttranslational mechanisms attenuate their expression when their encoding genes are in excess. Our proteomic analyses further revealed a novel aneuploidy-associated protein expression signature characteristic of altered metabolism and redox homeostasis. Indeed aneuploid cells harbor increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, increased protein turnover attenuates ROS levels and this novel aneuploidy-associated signature and improves the fitness of most aneuploid strains. Our results show that aneuploidy causes alterations in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Cells respond to these alterations through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.},

@article{Winsor2013,
abstract = {RNA polymerase II translocates across much of the genome and since it can be blocked by many kinds of DNA lesions, detects DNA damage proficiently; it thereby contributes to DNA repair and to normal levels of DNA damage resistance. However, the components and mechanisms that respond to polymerase blockage are largely unknown, except in the case of UV-induced damage that is corrected by nucleotide excision repair. Because elongating RNAPII carries with it numerous proteins that bind to its hyperphosphorylated CTD, we tested for effects of interfering with this binding. We find that expressing a decoy CTD-carrying protein in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, leads to reduced DNA damage resistance. Likewise, inducing aberrant phosphorylation of the CTD, by deleting CTK1, reduces damage resistance and also alters rates of homologous recombination-mediated repair. In line with these results, extant data sets reveal a remarkable, highly significant overlap between phosphoCTD-associating protein genes and DNA damage-resistance genes. For one well-known phosphoCTD-associating protein, the histone methyltransferase Set2, we demonstrate a role in DNA damage resistance, and we show that this role requires the phosphoCTD binding ability of Set2; surprisingly, Set2's role in damage resistance does not depend on its catalytic activity. To explain all of these observations, we posit the existence of a CTD-Associated DNA damage Response (CAR) system, organized around the phosphoCTD of elongating RNAPII and comprising a subset of phosphoCTD-associating proteins.},

A major challenge is to compare profiles collected in a complex phylogeny. Here, we present Arboretum, a novel scalable computational algorithm that integrates expression data from multiple species with species and gene phylogenies to infer modules of coexpressed genes in extant species and their evolutionary histories. We also develop new, generally applicable measures of conservation and divergence in gene regulatory modules to assess the impact of changes in gene content and expression on module evolution. We used Arboretum to study the evolution of the transcriptional response to heat shock in eight species of Ascomycota fungi and to reconstruct modules of the ancestral environmental stress response (ESR). We found substantial conservation in the stress response across species and in the reconstructed components of the ancestral ESR modules. The greatest divergence was in the most induced stress, primarily through module expansion. The divergence of the heat stress response exceeds that observed in the response to glucose depletion in the same species. Arboretum and its associated analyses provide a comprehensive framework to systematically study regulatory evolution of condition-specific responses.},

abstract = {We have compared the toxicity, mutagenicity and transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of three DNA-intercalating fluorescent dyes widely used to stain DNA in gels. Safety data about ethidium bromide (EtBr) are contradictory, and two compounds of undisclosed structure (Redsafe and Gelred) have been proposed as safe alternatives. Our results indicate that all three compounds inhibit yeast growth, with Gelred being the most inhibitory and also the only one causing cell death. EtBr and Gelred, but not Redsafe, induce massive formation of petite (non-respiratory) mutants, but only EtBr induces massive loss of mitochondrial DNA. All three compounds increase reversion of a chromosomal point mutation (lys2-801(amber) ), with Gelred being the most mutagenic and Redsafe the least. These dyes are all cationic and are probably taken by cells through non-selective cation channels. We could measure the glucose-energized transport of EtBr and Gelred inside the cells, while uptake of Redsafe was below our detection limit. We conclude that although all three compounds are toxic and mutagenic in the yeast system, Redsafe is the safest for yeast, probably because of very limited uptake by these cells.

Whereas some techniques, such as those for analyzing protein complexes, have matured and are broadly applied with great success, others, such as global quantitative protein expression profiling for biomarker discovery, are still confined to a few expert laboratories. In this Perspective, we attempt to distill the wide array of conceivable proteomic approaches into a compact canon of techniques suited to asking and answering specific types of biological questions. By discussing the relationship between the complexity of a biological sample and the difficulty of implementing the appropriate analysis approach, we contrast areas of proteomics broadly usable today with those that require significant technical and conceptual development. We hope to provide nonexperts with a guide for calibrating expectations of what can realistically be learned from a proteomics experiment and for gauging the planning and execution effort.

abstract = {The increasing scale and complexity of quantitative proteomics studies complicate subsequent analysis of the acquired data. Untargeted label-free quantification, based either on feature intensities or on spectral counting, is a method that scales particularly well with respect to the number of samples. It is thus an excellent alternative to labeling techniques. In order to profit from this scalability, however, data analysis has to cope with large amounts of data, process them automatically, and do a thorough statistical analysis in order to achieve reliable results. We review the state of the art with respect to computational tools for label-free quantification in untargeted proteomics. The two fundamental approaches are feature-based quantification, relying on the summed-up mass spectrometric intensity of peptides, and spectral counting, which relies on the number of MS/MS spectra acquired for a certain protein. We review the current algorithmic approaches underlying some widely used software packages and briefly discuss the statistical strategies for analyzing the data.},

However, with a multitude of experimental setups to choose from, as well as a wide array of software solutions for subsequent data processing, it is non-trivial to select the most appropriate workflow for a given biological question. In this review, we highlight different issues that need to be addressed by software for quantitative LC-MS experiments and describe different approaches that are available. With focus on label-free quantification, examples are discussed both for LC-MS/MS and LC-SRM data processing. We further elaborate on current quality control methodology for performing accurate protein quantification experiments.

abstract = {Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, the large-scale analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry, has emerged as a new technology over the last decade and become routine in many plant biology laboratories. While early work consisted merely of listing proteins identified in a given organ or under different conditions of interest, there is a growing need to apply comparative and quantitative proteomics strategies toward gaining novel insights into functional aspects of plant proteins and their dynamics. However, during the transition from qualitative to quantitative protein analysis, the potential and challenges will be tightly coupled. Several strategies for differential proteomics that involve stable isotopes or label-free comparisons and their statistical assessment are possible, each having specific strengths and limitations. Furthermore, incomplete proteome coverage and restricted dynamic range still impose the strongest limitations to data throughput and precise quantitative analysis. This review gives an overview of the current state of the art in differential proteomics and possible strategies in data processing.},

abstract = {It was inevitable that as soon as mass spectrometrists were able to tell biologists which proteins were in their samples, the next question would be how much of these proteins were present. This has turned out to be a much more challenging question. In this review, we describe the multiple ways that mass spectrometry has attempted to address this issue, both for relative quantitation and for absolute quantitation of proteins. There is no single method that will work for every problem or for every sample. What we present here is a variety of techniques, with guidelines that we hope will assist the researcher in selecting the most appropriate technique for the particular biological problem that needs to be addressed. We need to emphasize that this is a very active area of proteomics research-new quantitative methods are continuously being introduced and some 'pitfalls' of older methods are just being discovered. However, even though there is no perfect technique--and a better technique may be developed tomorrow--valuable information on biomarkers and pathways can be obtained using these currently available methods.},

Even researchers experienced in the proteomics field can find it challenging to follow existing publication guidelines for MS-based protein identification and characterization in detail. One of the primary goals of bioinformatics is to enable any researcher to interpret the vast amounts of data generated in modern biology, by providing user-friendly and robust end-user applications, clear documentation, and corresponding teaching materials. In that spirit, we here present an extensive tutorial for peptide and protein identification, available at http://compomics.com/bioinformatics-for-proteomics. The material is completely based on freely available and open-source tools, and has already been used and refined at numerous international courses over the past 3 years. During this time, it has demonstrated its ability to allow even complete beginners to intuitively conduct advanced bioinformatics workflows, interpret the results, and understand their context. This tutorial is thus aimed at fully empowering users, by removing black boxes in the proteomics informatics pipeline.},

However, the physiological role of these repeats and the consequences of more moderate repeat variation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Q-rich domains are highly enriched in eukaryotic transcription factors where they act as functional modulators. Incremental changes in the number of repeats in the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 (Cyc8) result in systematic, repeat-length-dependent variation in expression of target genes that result in direct phenotypic changes. The function of Ssn6 increases with its repeat number until a certain threshold where further expansion leads to aggregation. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the Ssn6 repeats affect its solubility and interactions with Tup1 and other regulators. Thus, Q-rich repeats are dynamic functional domains that modulate a regulator's innate function, with the inherent risk of pathogenic repeat expansions.},

Each of 32 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was genotyped at 30 SNP loci discovered by sequence alignment of the S. cerevisiae laboratory strain SK1 to the database sequence of strain S288c. In total, 10 SNPs were selected from each of the following three categories: promoter regions, nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (in open reading frames). The strains in this study included 11 haploid laboratory strains used for genetic studies and 21 diploids. Three non-cerevisiae species of Saccharomyces (sensu stricto) were used as an out-group. A Bayesian clustering-algorithm, Structure, effectively identified four different strain groups: laboratory, wine, other diploids and the non-cerevisiae species. Analysing haploid and diploid strains together caused problems for phylogeny reconstruction, but not for the clustering produced by Structure. The ascertainment bias introduced by the SNP discovery method caused difficulty in the phylogenetic analysis; alternative options are proposed. A smaller data set, comprising only the nine most polymorphic loci, was sufficient to obtain most features of the results.},

@article{Kabani2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbors several prions that constitute powerful models to investigate the mechanisms of epigenetic structural inheritance. [PSI(+)] is undoubtedly the best-known yeast prion and results from the conversion of the translation termination factor Sup35p into self-perpetuating protein aggregates. Structurally different conformers of Sup35p aggregates can lead to [PSI(+)] strains with weak or strong prion phenotypes. Yeast prions are faithfully transmitted from mother to daughter cells during cell division, upon cytoplasmic mixing during mating, or when Sup35p fibrils made in test tubes are introduced into spheroplasts. Virtually all living cells in the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, secrete small membrane vesicles in the extracellular space. These extracellular vesicles (EV) have gained increasing interest as vehicles for the intercellular transfer of signaling molecules, nucleic acids, and pathogenic factors, as well as prion-like protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases. To begin to explore the question of whether EV could represent a natural mean for yeast prion transmission from cell to cell, we purified these extracellular vesicles and assessed whether they contained Sup35p. Here, we show that Sup35p is secreted within EV released in the extracellular medium of yeast cultures. We demonstrate that Sup35p within EV isolated from strong and weak [PSI(+)] cells is in an infectious prion conformation. Among the possible implications of our work is the possibility of previously unsuspected EV-mediated horizontal cell-to-cell transfer of fungal prions.

IMPORTANCE: Most living cells in the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, secrete small membrane vesicles in the extracellular space. These extracellular vesicles (EV) were long viewed as "trash cans" by which cells disposed of unwanted macromolecules. EV gained renewed interest as their roles as vehicles for the cell-to-cell transfer of nucleic acids, signaling molecules, and pathogenic factors were recently uncovered. Of particular interest is their proposed role in the prion-like propagation of toxic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. Yeasts naturally harbor prion proteins that are excellent models to investigate the mechanisms of formation, propagation, and elimination of self-perpetuating protein aggregates. Here we show for the first time that a yeast prion is secreted within EV in its infectious aggregated state. A major implication of our work is the possibility of EV-mediated horizontal spread of fungal prions.},

abstract = {A number of cellular proteins localize to discrete foci within cells, for example DNA repair proteins, microtubule organizing centers, P bodies or kinetochores. It is often possible to measure the fluorescence emission from tagged proteins within these foci as a surrogate for the concentration of that specific protein. We wished to develop tools that would allow quantitation of fluorescence foci intensities in high-throughput studies. As proof of principle we have examined the kinetochore, a large multi-subunit complex that is critical for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Kinetochore perturbations lead to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. Hence, understanding kinetochore homeostasis and regulation are important for a global understanding of cell division and genome integrity. The 16 budding yeast kinetochores colocalize within the nucleus to form a single focus. Here we have created a set of freely-available tools to allow high-throughput quantitation of kinetochore foci fluorescence. We use this 'FociQuant' tool to compare methods of kinetochore quantitation and we show proof of principle that FociQuant can be used to identify changes in kinetochore protein levels in a mutant that affects kinetochore function. This analysis can be applied to any protein that forms discrete foci in cells.},

abstract = {Lager brewing strains of Saccharomyces pastorianus are natural interspecific hybrids originating from the spontaneous hybridization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus. Over the past 500 years, S. pastorianus has been domesticated to become one of the most important industrial microorganisms. Production of lager-type beers requires a set of essential phenotypes, including the ability to ferment maltose and maltotriose at low temperature, the production of flavors and aromas, and the ability to flocculate. Understanding of the molecular basis of complex brewing-related phenotypic traits is a prerequisite for rational strain improvement. While genome sequences have been reported, the variability and dynamics of S. pastorianus genomes have not been investigated in detail. Here, using deep sequencing and chromosome copy number analysis, we showed that S. pastorianus strain CBS1483 exhibited extensive aneuploidy. This was confirmed by quantitative PCR and by flow cytometry. As a direct consequence of this aneuploidy, a massive number of sequence variants was identified, leading to at least 1,800 additional protein variants in S. pastorianus CBS1483. Analysis of eight additional S. pastorianus strains revealed that the previously defined group I strains showed comparable karyotypes, while group II strains showed large interstrain karyotypic variability. Comparison of three strains with nearly identical genome sequences revealed substantial chromosome copy number variation, which may contribute to strain-specific phenotypic traits. The observed variability of lager yeast genomes demonstrates that systematic linking of genotype to phenotype requires a three-dimensional genome analysis encompassing physical chromosomal structures, the copy number of individual chromosomes or chromosomal regions, and the allelic variation of copies of individual genes.},

abstract = {Our knowledge of yeast genomes remains largely dominated by the extensive studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the consequences of its ancestral duplication, leaving the evolution of the entire class of hemiascomycetes only partly explored. We concentrate here on five species of Saccharomycetaceae, a large subdivision of hemiascomycetes, that we call "protoploid" because they diverged from the S. cerevisiae lineage prior to its genome duplication. We determined the complete genome sequences of three of these species: Kluyveromyces (Lachancea) thermotolerans and Saccharomyces (Lachancea) kluyveri (two members of the newly described Lachancea clade), and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. We included in our comparisons the previously available sequences of Kluyveromyces lactis and Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii. Despite their broad evolutionary range and significant individual variations in each lineage, the five protoploid Saccharomycetaceae share a core repertoire of approximately 3300 protein families and a high degree of conserved synteny. Synteny blocks were used to define gene orthology and to infer ancestors. Far from representing minimal genomes without redundancy, the five protoploid yeasts contain numerous copies of paralogous genes, either dispersed or in tandem arrays, that, altogether, constitute a third of each genome. Ancient, conserved paralogs as well as novel, lineage-specific paralogs were identified.},

abstract = {Prions are proteins most commonly associated with fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but are also responsible for a number of harmless heritable phenotypes in yeast. These states arise when a misfolded form of a protein appears and, rather than be removed by cellular quality control mechanisms, persists. The misfolded prion protein forms aggregates and is capable of converting normally folded protein to the misfolded state through direct interaction between the two forms. The dominant mathematical model for prion aggregate dynamics has been the nucleated polymerization model (NPM) which considers the dynamics of only the normal protein and the aggregates. However, for yeast prions the molecular chaperone Hsp104 is essential for prion propagation. Further, although mammals do not express Hsp104, experimental assays have shown Hsp104 also interacts with mammalian prion aggregates. In this study, we generalize the NPM to account for molecular chaperones and develop what we call the enzyme-limited nucleated polymerization model (ELNPM). We discuss existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions to our model and demonstrate that the NPM represents a quasi-steady-state reduction of our model. We validate the ELNPM by demonstrating agreement with experimental results on the yeast prion [Formula: see text] PSI [Formula: see text] that could not be supported by the NPM. Finally, we demonstrate that, in contrast to the NPM, the ELNPM permits the coexistence of multiple prion strains.},

abstract = {The molecular basis by which fungal and mammalian prions arise spontaneously is poorly understood. A number of different environmental stress conditions are known to increase the frequency of yeast [PSI(+)] prion formation in agreement with the idea that conditions which cause protein misfolding may promote the conversion of normally soluble proteins to their amyloid forms. A recent study from our laboratory has shown that the de novo formation of the [PSI(+)] prion is significantly increased in yeast mutants lacking key antioxidants suggesting that endogenous reactive oxygen species are sufficient to promote prion formation. Our findings strongly implicate oxidative damage of Sup35 as an important trigger for the formation of the heritable [PSI(+)] prion in yeast. This review discusses the mechanisms by which the direct oxidation of Sup35 might lead to structural transitions favoring conversion to the transmissible amyloid-like form. This is analogous to various environmental factors which have been proposed to trigger misfolding of the mammalian prion protein (PrP(C)) into the aggregated scrapie form (PrP(Sc)).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome annotation is one way of summarizing the existing knowledge about genomic characteristics of an organism. There has been an increased interest during the last several decades in computer-based structural and functional genome annotation. Many methods for this purpose have been developed for eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Our study focuses on comparison of functional annotations of prokaryotic genomes. To the best of our knowledge there is no fully automated system for detailed comparison of functional genome annotations generated by different annotation methods (AMs).

RESULTS: The presence of many AMs and development of new ones introduce needs to: a/ compare different annotations for a single genome, and b/ generate annotation by combining individual ones. To address these issues we developed an Automated Tool for Bacterial GEnome Annotation ComparisON (BEACON) that benefits both AM developers and annotation analysers. BEACON provides detailed comparison of gene function annotations of prokaryotic genomes obtained by different AMs and generates extended annotations through combination of individual ones. For the illustration of BEACON's utility, we provide a comparison analysis of multiple different annotations generated for four genomes and show on these examples that the extended annotation can increase the number of genes annotated by putative functions up to 27 {\%}, while the number of genes without any function assignment is reduced.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed BEACON, a fast tool for an automated and a systematic comparison of different annotations of single genomes. The extended annotation assigns putative functions to many genes with unknown functions.

abstract = {The domestication of the wine yeast S. cerevisiae is thought to be contemporary with the development and expansion of viticulture along the Mediterranean basin. Until now, the unavailability of wild lineages prevented the identification of the closest wild relatives of wine yeasts. Here, we enlarge the collection of natural lineages and employ whole genome data of oak-associated wild isolates to study a balanced number of anthropic and natural S. cerevisiae strains. We identified industrial variants and new geographically delimited populations, including a novel Mediterranean oak population. This population is the closest relative of the wine lineage as shown by a weak population structure and further supported by genome-wide population analyses. A coalescent model considering partial isolation with asymmetrical migration, mostly from the wild group into the Wine group, and population growth, was found to be best supported by the data. Importantly, divergence time estimates between the two populations agree with historical evidence for winemaking. We show that three horizontally transmitted regions, previously described to contain genes relevant to wine fermentation, are present in the Wine group but not in the Mediterranean oak group. This represents a major discontinuity between the two populations and is likely to denote a domestication fingerprint in wine yeasts. Taken together, these results indicate that Mediterranean oaks harbor the wild genetic stock of domesticated wine yeasts. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Earlier studies have focused on establishing when these events occurred and on elucidating their functional and evolutionary consequences, but we still lack sufficient understanding of how genome duplications first originated. We used phylogenomics to study the ancient genome duplication occurred in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lineage and found compelling evidence for the existence of a contemporaneous interspecies hybridization. We propose that the genome doubling was a direct consequence of this hybridization and that it served to provide stability to the recently formed allopolyploid. This scenario provides a mechanism for the origin of this ancient duplication and the lineage that originated from it and brings a new perspective to the interpretation of the origin and consequences of whole-genome duplications.},

They double an organism's genetic content, immediately creating a reproductive barrier between it and its ancestors and providing raw material for the divergence of gene functions between paralogs. Almost all eukaryotic genome sequences bear evidence of ancient WGDs, but the causes of these events and the timing of intermediate steps have been difficult to discern. One of the best-characterized WGDs occurred in the lineage leading to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Although gene conversions have been extensively studied in yeasts, very little is known about their selective impact in pathological yeasts. Here, we used the GENECONV software to compare the characteristics of candidate gene conversions found in a pathogenic strain (YJM789) and a nonpathogenic strain (S288c) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, the pathogenic strain has fewer gene conversions when compared with the nonpathogenic strain. Of the 123 conversions we identified, 27 were identical or similar between the two strains, 62 were specific to the S288c strain, and 34 were specific to the YJM789 strain. Identical and similar conversions likely represent conversions that are under similar levels of purifying selection in both strains. The lower number of gene conversions in most gene families of the pathogenic strain is likely the result of higher purifying selection in this strain. In contrast, the higher number of conversions found in the YRF1 helicase gene family of the pathogenic strain could represent an example of adaptive gene conversions involved in maintaining its telomeres.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome variability generates phenotypic heterogeneity and is of relevance for adaptation to environmental change, but the extent of such variability in natural populations is still poorly understood. For example, selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are variable at the ploidy level, have gene amplifications, changes in chromosome copy number, and gross chromosomal rearrangements. This suggests that genome plasticity provides important genetic diversity upon which natural selection mechanisms can operate.

RESULTS: In this study, we have used wild-type S. cerevisiae (yeast) strains to investigate genome variation in natural and artificial environments. We have used comparative genome hybridization on array (aCGH) to characterize the genome variability of 16 yeast strains, of laboratory and commercial origin, isolated from vineyards and wine cellars, and from opportunistic human infections. Interestingly, sub-telomeric instability was associated with the clinical phenotype, while Ty element insertion regions determined genomic differences of natural wine fermentation strains. Copy number depletion of ASP3 and YRF1 genes was found in all wild-type strains. Other gene families involved in transmembrane transport, sugar and alcohol metabolism or drug resistance had copy number changes, which also distinguished wine from clinical isolates.

CONCLUSION: We have isolated and genotyped more than 1000 yeast strains from natural environments and carried out an aCGH analysis of 16 strains representative of distinct genotype clusters. Important genomic variability was identified between these strains, in particular in sub-telomeric regions and in Ty-element insertion sites, suggesting that this type of genome variability is the main source of genetic diversity in natural populations of yeast. The data highlights the usefulness of yeast as a model system to unravel intraspecific natural genome diversity and to elucidate how natural selection shapes the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Excessive expansions of glutamine (Q)-rich repeats in various human proteins are known to result in severe neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and several ataxias. However, the physiological role of these repeats and the consequences of more moderate repeat variation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Q-rich domains are highly enriched in eukaryotic transcription factors where they act as functional modulators. Incremental changes in the number of repeats in the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 (Cyc8) result in systematic, repeat-length-dependent variation in expression of target genes that result in direct phenotypic changes. The function of Ssn6 increases with its repeat number until a certain threshold where further expansion leads to aggregation. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the Ssn6 repeats affect its solubility and interactions with Tup1 and other regulators. Thus, Q-rich repeats are dynamic functional domains that modulate a regulator's innate function, with the inherent risk of pathogenic repeat expansions.},

abstract = {While screening a large collection of wild and laboratory yeast strains for their ability to attract Drosophila melanogaster adults, we noticed a large difference in fly preference for two nearly isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BY4741 and BY4742. Using standard genetic analyses, we tracked the preference difference to the lack of mitochondria in the BY4742 strain used in the initial experiment. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY4742, and found that they differed significantly. We observed that several ethyl esters are present at much higher levels in strains with mitochondria, even in fermentative conditions. We found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these compounds, and that they are produced at the highest level by strains with mitochondria when fermenting natural fruit substrates. Collectively these observations demonstrate that core metabolic processes mediate the interaction between yeasts and insect vectors, and highlight the importance mitochondrial functions in yeast ecology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evolution of microbial populations provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary adaptation in response to controlled selective pressures. However, until recently it has been difficult to identify the precise genetic changes underlying adaptation at a genome-wide scale. New DNA sequencing technologies now allow the genome of parental and evolved strains of microorganisms to be rapidly determined.

RESULTS: We sequenced >93.5{\%} of the genome of a laboratory-evolved strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its ancestor at >28x depth. Both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number amplifications were found, with specific gains over array-based methodologies previously used to analyze these genomes. Applying a segmentation algorithm to quantify structural changes, we determined the approximate genomic boundaries of a 5x gene amplification. These boundaries guided the recovery of breakpoint sequences, which provide insights into the nature of a complex genomic rearrangement.

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that whole-genome sequencing can provide a rapid approach to uncover the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations, with further applications in the study of laboratory selections and mutagenesis screens. In addition, we show how single-end, short read sequencing data can provide detailed information about structural rearrangements, and generate predictions about the genomic features and processes that underlie genome plasticity.},

However, study of segmental aneuploids is severely hampered by the difficulty of creating them in a designed fashion. Here, we describe a PCR-mediated chromosome duplication (PCDup) technology that enables the generation of segmental aneuploidy at any desired chromosomal region in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed multiple strains harboring 100 kb to 200 kb segmental duplications covering the whole of the S. cerevisiae genome. Interestingly, some segmental aneuploidies confer stress tolerance, such as to high temperature, ethanol and strong acids, while others induce cell lethality and stress sensitivity, presumably as result of the simultaneous increases in dosages of multiple genes. We suggest that our PCDup technology will accelerate studies into the phenotypic changes resulting from alteration of gene dosage balance of multiple genes and will provide new insights into the adaptive molecular mechanisms in the genome in segmental aneuploidy-derived human diseases.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal in biology is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of how and to what extent ecological variation imposes selection for distinct traits and favors the fixation of specific genetic variants. Key to such an understanding is the detailed mapping of the natural genomic and phenomic space and a bridging of the gap that separates these worlds. Here we chart a high-resolution map of natural trait variation in one of the most important genetic model organisms, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its closest wild relatives and trace the genetic basis and timing of major phenotype changing events in its recent history. We show that natural trait variation in S. cerevisiae exceeds that of its relatives, despite limited genetic variation, and follows the population history rather than the source environment. In particular, the West African population is phenotypically unique, with an extreme abundance of low-performance alleles, notably a premature translational termination signal in GAL3 that cause inability to utilize galactose. Our observations suggest that many S. cerevisiae traits may be the consequence of genetic drift rather than selection, in line with the assumption that natural yeast lineages are remnants of recent population bottlenecks. Disconcertingly, the universal type strain S288C was found to be highly atypical, highlighting the danger of extrapolating gene-trait connections obtained in mosaic, lab-domesticated lineages to the species as a whole. Overall, this study represents a step towards an in-depth understanding of the causal relationship between co-variation in ecology, selection pressure, natural traits, molecular mechanism, and alleles in a key model organism.},

This is especially true for baking strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The success of this yeast in the ancient art of bread making is based on its capacity to rapidly transform carbohydrates into CO2 rather than its unusual resistance to environmental stresses. Moreover, baker's yeast must exhibit efficient respiratory metabolism during yeast manufacturing, which determines biomass yield. However, optimal growth conditions often have negative consequences in other commercially important aspects, such as fermentative power or stress tolerance. This article reviews the genetic and physiological characteristics of baking yeast strains, emphasizing the activation of regulatory mechanisms in response to carbon source and stress signaling and their importance in defining targets for strain selection and improvement.},

Some desirable properties of bakers' yeast may be altered if fermentation rather than respiration occurs during biomass production. That is why differences in gene expression patterns that take place when industrial bakers' yeasts are grown under fermentative, rather than respiratory conditions, were examined. Macroarray analysis of V1 strain indicated changes in gene expression similar to those already described in laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains: repression of most genes related to respiration and oxidative metabolism and derepression of genes related to ribosome biogenesis and stress resistance in fermentation. Under respiratory conditions, genes related to the glyoxylate and Krebs cycles, respiration, gluconeogenesis, and energy production are activated. DOG21 strain, a partly catabolite-derepressed mutant derived from V1, displayed gene expression patterns quite similar to those of V1, although lower levels of gene expression and changes in fewer number of genes as compared to V1 were both detected in all cases. However, under fermentative conditions, DOG21 mutant significantly increased the expression of SNF1 -controlled genes and other genes involved in stress resistance, whereas the expression of the HXK2 gene, involved in catabolite repression, was considerably reduced, according to the pleiotropic stress-resistant phenotype of this mutant. These results also seemed to suggest that stress-resistant genes control desirable bakers' yeast qualities.},

Phylogenetic trees and conserved gene order relationships show that the common ancestor of five closely related hemiascomycetous yeast species contained the RSB1 and PUG1 paralogous genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rsb1 functions as a transporter or translocase of sphingoid bases, whereas Pug1 facilitates the inducible transport of protoporphyrin IX and hemin. The budding yeast contains two other paralogs, Ylr046p, of unknown function, and Rta1p, overexpression of which confers resistance to an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor. Large-scale mRNA expression profiling has shown that transcription of PUG1, RTA1 and YLR046 is induced under hypoxic conditions. Ergosterol biosynthesis is impaired under low-oxygen conditions as a consequence of the decreased synthesis of heme and heme-containing proteins. These genes may encode transporters or sensors that facilitate the excretion of excessive or aberrant biosynthetic intermediates, either directly or indirectly. The expression of RSB1 and RTA1 is under the control of pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factors, suggesting that the encoded proteins may have additional roles in cell resistance to xenobiotics.

The RTM1 gene encodes a hydrophobic 34-kD protein that contains seven potential transmembrane-spanning segments. Analysis of a series of industrial strains shows that the sequence is present in multiple copies and in variable locations in the genome. RTM loci are always physically associated with SUC telomeric loci. The SUC-RTM sequences are located between X and Y' subtelomeric sequences at chromosome ends. Surprisingly RTM sequences are not detected in the laboratory strain X2180. The lack of this sequence is associated with the absence of any SUC telomeric gene previously described. This observation raises the question of the origin of this nonessential gene. The particular subtelomeric position might explain the SUC-RTM sequence amplification observed in the genome of yeasts used in industrial biomass or ethanol production with molasses as substrate.

Here, we analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions of the Sup35 protein through the prism of this structural model. Application of a newly developed computational approach, called ArchCandy, gives us a better understanding of the effect caused by mutations on the fibril forming potential of Sup35 protein. This bioinformatics tool can be used for the design of new mutations with desired modification of prion properties.

In the current study, we used comparative genomics to uncover the extent of the genomic alterations that occurred during the evolution process and investigated possible associations between the mutations and the phenotypic traits in ISO12.RESULTS:Through whole-genome sequencing and variant calling we identified a high number of strain-unique SNPs and INDELs in both ISO12 and the parental strain Ethanol Red. The variants were predicted to have 760 non-synonymous effects in both strains combined and were significantly enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to cell periphery, membranes and cell wall. Eleven genes, including MTL1, FLO9/FLO11, and CYC3 were found to be under positive selection in ISO12. Additionally, the FLO genes exhibited changes in copy number, and the alterations to this gene family were correlated with experimental results of multicellularity and invasive growth in the adapted strain. An independent lipidomic analysis revealed further differences between the strains in the content of nine lipid species. Finally, ISO12 displayed improved viability in undiluted spruce hydrolysate that was unrelated to reduction of inhibitors and changes in cell wall integrity, as shown by HPLC and lyticase assays.CONCLUSIONS:Together, the results of the sequence comparison and the physiological characterisations indicate that cell-periphery proteins (e.g. extracellular sensors such as MTL1) and peripheral lipids/membranes are important evolutionary targets in the process of adaptation to the combined stresses. The capacity of ISO12 to develop complex colony formation also revealed multicellularity as a possible evolutionary strategy to improve competitiveness and tolerance to environmental stresses (also reflected by the FLO genes). Although a panel of altered genes with high relevance to the novel phenotype was detected, this study also demonstrates that the observed long-term molecular effects of thermal and inhibitor stress have polygenetic basis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The degeneracy of the genetic code makes it possible for the same amino acid string to be coded by different messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences. These "synonymous mRNAs" may differ largely in a number of aspects related to their overall translational efficiency, such as secondary structure content and availability of the encoded transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Consequently, they may render different yields of the translated polypeptides. These mRNA features related to translation efficiency are also playing a role locally, resulting in a non-uniform translation speed along the mRNA, which has been previously related to some protein structural features and also used to explain some dramatic effects of "silent" single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs). In this work we perform the first large scale analysis of the relationship between three experimental proxies of mRNA local translation efficiency and the local features of the corresponding encoded proteins.RESULTS:We found that a number of protein functional and structural features are reflected in the patterns of ribosome occupancy, secondary structure and tRNA availability along the mRNA. One or more of these proxies of translation speed have distinctive patterns around the mRNA regions coding for certain protein local features. In some cases the three patterns follow a similar trend. We also show specific examples where these patterns of translation speed point to the protein's important structural and functional features.CONCLUSIONS:This support the idea that the genome not only codes the protein functional features as sequences of amino acids, but also as subtle patterns of mRNA properties which, probably through local effects on the translation speed, have some consequence on the final polypeptide. These results open the possibility of predicting a protein's functional regions based on a single genomic sequence, and have implications for heterologous protein expression and fine-tuning protein function.},

abstract = {Cells are constantly confronted with endogenous and exogenous factors that affect their genomes. Eons of evolution have allowed the cellular mechanisms responsible for preserving the genome to adjust for achieving contradictory objectives: to maintain the genome unchanged and to acquire mutations that allow adaptation to environmental changes. One evolutionary mechanism that has been refined for survival is genetic variation. In this review, we describe the mechanisms responsible for two biological processes: genome maintenance and mutation tolerance involved in generations of genetic variations in mitotic cells of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These processes encompass mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of replication, DNA lesion sensing and DNA damage response pathways, as well as mechanisms that ensure precision in chromosome segregation during cell division. We discuss various factors that may influence genome stability, such as cellular ploidy, the phase of the cell cycle, transcriptional activity of a particular region of DNA, the proficiency of DNA quality control systems, the metabolic stage of the cell and its respiratory potential, and finally potential exposure to endogenous or environmental stress.},
annote = {2015{\_}Skoneczna, Kaniak, Skoneczny{\_}Sources of genomic instability in budding and fission yeast


{\#}DNA polymerases
S. cerevisiae 11 DNA polymerases; S. pombe: 12, human: up to 18.
Replicative: alpha (1/10{\^{}}4--5), delta and epsilon (1/10{\^{}}5--7); gamma for mtDNA (1/10{\^{}}5--6)
TLS: zeta and beta (1/10{\^{}}3--4), as well as eta (1/10{\^{}}1--2); however zeta is considered the most mutagenic
phi (DNA polymerase, beta family): rRNA transcription
Rev1 does not use canonical Watson-Crick base pairing
delta: often generates single nucleotide deletions in homopolymeric runs and wastefully proofreads these types of mismatches with a much higher error ratePol delta strand slippage on repetitive sequences is is considered the major source of indels
Genome instability phenotypes have been reported for cdc45, csm3, ctf18, dpb11, pol30 and sld4. Mutations in replication fork protein genes lead to GCR while polymerase defects lead mainly to base substitutions and frameshifts.
{\#}dNTP concentration and all that
{\#}BER, MMR
Polymerase switch can be ubiquitin dependent
eta is the only polymerase for which transcriptional activation of the encoding gene following DNA damage has been demostrated in budding yeast. 
{\#}DSB: programmed vs 
Haploid cells: both HR and NHEJ are functional. Diploid cells: NHEJ is inhibited due to the mating-type control-mediated repression of NEJ1. In both haploids and diploids, HR primarily takes place in S and G2. 
4 HR subpathways: (1) double HJ = DSB repair; (2) synthesis-dependent strand annealing; (3) break-induced recombination; (4) single-strand annealing; (5) error-free lesion bypass pathway.


{\#}Ploidy
Frequency of spontaneous mutagenesis in forward mutation assays: CAN1/can1delta and URA3/ura3delta is two orders of magnitude HIGHER than in haploids.
{\#}Chromosome instability
Hsp90 stress ={\&}gt; adaptation ={\&}gt; induction of aneuploidy
DSB stress, hydroquinone-induced delay at G2/M transition and other events may lead to aneuploidization (gain or loss of individual chromosomes)
Sc. pombe are primarily euploid. In S. cerevisiae, monosomy can be tolerated (especially III). No strong correlation between the frequency of chromosome loss and the size of the chromosome. E.g. III and XII are lost at similar rates. XV gain: 10{\^{}}-6--7; after antifungal drug treatment it increases by approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude.
Quick fix see Yona.
aft1 cells have chromosome segregation defects as Aft1 associates with the kinetochore complex through Iml3 and, similar to Iml3, is required for the increased association of cohesin with pericentric chromatin
Ploidy shift towards diploid state
Types of chromosome attachment: amphitelic (=norm), monotelic, syntelic, merotelic (with pictures!)


{\#}Transcription
It is no surprise that transcription affects genome stability. 18-42 nt/second. If yeast had very long genes like human (1M) it would take more than one round of replication.
Actively transcribed genes are affixed near nuclear pores.
TAGIN (transcription-associated genome instability): TAM + TAR
TAM: first data were connected with the finding that induction of expression of some genes caused significant elevation of mutation rate.
TAM as an adaptive mechanism: starvation-induced expression of specific genes lead to increased mutagenesis within their sequences ={\&}gt; potential benefits to cells under strong selective pressure

abstract = {The evolutionary history of the characters underlying the adaptation of microorganisms to food and biotechnological uses is poorly understood. We undertook comparative genomics to investigate evolutionary relationships of the dairy yeast Geotrichum candidum within Saccharomycotina. Surprisingly, a remarkable proportion of genes showed discordant phylogenies, clustering with the filamentous fungus subphylum (Pezizomycotina), rather than the yeast subphylum (Saccharomycotina), of the Ascomycota. These genes appear not to be the result of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), but to have been specifically retained by G. candidum after the filamentous fungi-yeasts split concomitant with the yeasts' genome contraction. We refer to these genes as SRAGs (Specifically Retained Ancestral Genes), having been lost by all or nearly all other yeasts, and thus contributing to the phenotypic specificity of lineages. SRAG functions include lipases consistent with a role in cheese making and novel endoglucanases associated with degradation of plant material. Similar gene retention was observed in three other distantly related yeasts representative of this ecologically diverse subphylum. The phenomenon thus appears to be widespread in the Saccharomycotina and argues that, alongside neo-functionalization following gene duplication and HGT, specific gene retention must be recognized as an important mechanism for generation of biodiversity and adaptation in yeasts.},

Bigger and bigger parts of the genetic information have been exchanged or added over the years. Now we are at a point where the construction of entire chromosomes becomes a reachable goal and first examples appear. This development leads to fundamental new questions, for example, about what is possible and desirable to build or what construction rules one needs to follow when building synthetic chromosomes.

abstract = {Protein chaperones help proteins adopt and maintain native conformations and play vital roles in cellular processes where proteins are partially folded. They comprise a major part of the cellular protein quality control system that protects the integrity of the proteome. Many disorders are caused when proteins misfold despite this protection. Yeast prions are fibrous amyloid aggregates of misfolded proteins. The normal action of chaperones on yeast prions breaks the fibers into pieces, which results in prion replication. Because this process is necessary for propagation of yeast prions, even small differences in activity of many chaperones noticeably affect prion phenotypes. Several other factors involved in protein processing also influence formation, propagation or elimination of prions in yeast. Thus, in much the same way that the dependency of viruses on cellular functions has allowed us to learn much about cell biology, the dependency of yeast prions on chaperones presents a unique and sensitive way to monitor the functions and interactions of many components of the cell's protein quality control system. Our recent work illustrates the utility of this system for identifying and defining chaperone machinery interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Predictable control of gene expression is necessary for the rational design and optimization of cell factories. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the promoter is one of the most important tools available for controlling gene expression. However, the complex expression patterns of yeast promoters have not been fully characterised and compared on different carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, galactose and ethanol) and across the diauxic shift in glucose batch cultivation. These conditions are of importance to yeast cell factory design because they are commonly used and encountered in industrial processes. Here, the activities of a series of "constitutive" and inducible promoters were characterised in single cells throughout the fermentation using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter.RESULTS:The "constitutive" promoters, including glycolytic promoters, transcription elongation factor promoters and ribosomal promoters, differed in their response patterns to different carbon sources; however, in glucose batch cultivation, expression driven by these promoters decreased sharply as glucose was depleted and cells moved towards the diauxic shift. Promoters induced at low-glucose levels (P HXT7                    , P SSA1                    and P ADH2                    ) varied in induction strength on non-glucose carbon sources (sucrose, galactose and ethanol); in contrast to the "constitutive" promoters, GFP expression increased as glucose decreased and cells moved towards the diauxic shift. While lower than several "constitutive" promoters during the exponential phase, expression from the SSA1 promoter was higher in the post-diauxic phase than the commonly-used TEF1 promoter. The galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter provided the highest GFP expression on galactose, and the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter provided the highest induced GFP expression following the diauxic shift.CONCLUSIONS:The data provides a foundation for predictable and optimised control of gene expression levels on different carbon sources and throughout batch fermentation, including during and after the diauxic shift. This information can be applied for designing expression approaches to improve yields, rates and titres in yeast cell factories.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are self-perpetuating protein aggregates that cause heritable and transmissible phenotypic traits. Among these, [PSI+] and [URE3] stand out as the most studied yeast prions, and result from the self-assembly of the translation terminator Sup35p and the nitrogen catabolism regulator Ure2p, respectively, into insoluble fibrillar aggregates. Protein quality control systems are well known to govern the formation, propagation and transmission of these prions. However, little is known about the implication of the cellular proteolytic machineries in their turnover. We previously showed that the 26S proteasome degrades both the soluble and fibrillar forms of Sup35p and affects [PSI+] propagation. Here, we show that soluble native Ure2p is degraded by the proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent manner. Proteasomal degradation of Ure2p yields amyloidogenic N-terminal peptides and a C-terminal resistant fragment. In contrast to Sup35p, fibrillar Ure2p resists proteasomal degradation. Thus, structural variability within prions may dictate their ability to be degraded by the cellular proteolytic systems.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen. One of the important features of C. albicans pathogenicity is the ability to form biofilms on mucosal surfaces and indwelling medical devices. Biofilm formation involves complex processes in C. albicans, including cell adhesion, filamentous growth, extracellular matrix secretion and cell dispersion. In this work, we characterized the role of the transcription factor Sfp1, particularly with respect to its function in the regulation of biofilm formation. The deletion of the SFP1 gene enhanced cell adhesion and biofilm formation in comparison to the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the sfp1-deleted mutant also exhibited an increase in the expression of the ALS1, ALS3 and HWP1 genes, which encode adhesin proteins. In addition, Sfp1 was demonstrated to function downstream of the Rhb1-TOR signaling pathway. Bcr1 and Efg1 are transcription factors that are critical for controlling biofilm formation, and Efg1 is also required for hyphal growth. Deleting either the BCR1 or EFG1 gene in the sfp1-null background led to reduced adhesin gene expression. As a result, the bcr1/sfp1 or efg1/sfp1 double deletion mutants exhibited dramatically reduced biofilm formation. The results indicated that Sfp1 negatively regulates the ALS1, ALS3 and HWP1 adhesin genes and that the repression of these genes is mediated by the inhibition of Bcr1 and Efg1.},

abstract = {Web-based educational resources have gained enormous popularity recently and are increasingly becoming a part of modern educational systems. Virtual Labs are E-learning platforms where learners can gain the experience of practical experimentation without any direct physical involvement on real bench work. They use computerized simulations, models, videos, animations and other instructional technologies to create interactive content. Proteomics being one of the most rapidly growing fields of the biological sciences is now an important part of college and university curriculums. Consequently, many E-learning programs have started incorporating the theoretical and practical aspects of different proteomic techniques as an element of their course work in the form of Video Lectures and Virtual Labs. To this end, recently we have developed a Virtual Proteomics Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, which demonstrates different proteomics techniques, including basic and advanced gel and MS-based protein separation and identification techniques, bioinformatics tools and molecular docking methods, and their applications in different biological samples. This Tutorial will discuss the prominent Virtual Labs featuring proteomics content, including the Virtual Proteomics Lab of IIT-Bombay, and E-resources available for proteomics study that are striving to make proteomic techniques and concepts available and accessible to the student and research community. This Tutorial is part of the International Proteomics Tutorial Programme (IPTP 14). Details can be found at: http://www.proteomicstutorials.org/.},

The growing interest in the field of proteomics has triggered an increase in the development of new software libraries, including freely available and open-source software. From database search analysis to post-processing of the identification results, even though the objectives of these libraries and packages can vary significantly, they usually share a number of features. Common use cases include the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines output files, and the visualization of MS-related information (including mass spectra and chromatograms). In this review, we provide an overview of the existing software libraries, open-source frameworks and also, we give information on some of the freely available applications which make use of them.

In this review, we describe the multiple ways that mass spectrometry has attempted to address this issue, both for relative quantitation and for absolute quantitation of proteins. There is no single method that will work for every problem or for every sample. What we present here is a variety of techniques, with guidelines that we hope will assist the researcher in selecting the most appropriate technique for the particular biological problem that needs to be addressed. We need to emphasize that this is a very active area of proteomics research-new quantitative methods are continuously being introduced and some 'pitfalls' of older methods are just being discovered. However, even though there is no perfect technique--and a better technique may be developed tomorrow--valuable information on biomarkers and pathways can be obtained using these currently available methods.},

abstract = {Current proteomics technology is limited in resolving the proteome complexity of biological systems. The main issue at stake is to increase throughput and spectra quality so that spatiotemporal dimensions, population parameters and the complexity of protein modifications on a quantitative scale can be considered. MS-based proteomics and protein arrays are the main players in large-scale proteome analysis and an integration of these two methodologies is powerful but presently not sufficient for detailed quantitative and spatiotemporal proteome characterization. Improvements of instrumentation for MS-based proteomics have been achieved recently resulting in data sets of approximately one million spectra which is a large step in the right direction. The corresponding raw data range from 50 to 100 Gb and are frequently made available. Multidimensional LC-MS data sets have been demonstrated to identify and quantitate 2000-8000 proteins from whole cell extracts. The analysis of the resulting data sets requires several steps from raw data processing, to database-dependent search, statistical evaluation of the search result, quantitative algorithms and statistical analysis of quantitative data. A large number of software tools have been proposed for the above-mentioned tasks. However, it is not the aim of this review to cover all software tools, but rather discuss common data analysis strategies used by various algorithms for each of the above-mentioned steps in a non-redundant approach and to argue that there are still some areas which need improvements.},

abstract = {As a result of ancestral whole genome and small-scale duplication events, the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's, and of many eukaryotes, still contains a substantial fraction of duplicated genes. In all investigated organisms, metabolic pathways, and more particularly glycolysis, are specifically enriched for functionally redundant paralogs. In ancestors of the Saccharomyces lineage, the duplication of glycolytic genes is purported to have played an important role leading to S. cerevisiae current lifestyle favoring fermentative metabolism even in the presence of oxygen and characterized by a high glycolytic capacity. In modern S. cerevisiae, the 12 glycolytic reactions leading to the biochemical conversion from glucose to ethanol are encoded by 27 paralogs. In order to experimentally explore the physiological role of this genetic redundancy, a yeast strain with a minimal set of 14 paralogs was constructed (MG strain). Remarkably, a combination of quantitative, systems approach and of semi-quantitative analysis in a wide array of growth environments revealed the absence of phenotypic response to the cumulative deletion of 13 glycolytic paralogs. This observation indicates that duplication of glycolytic genes is not a prerequisite for achieving the high glycolytic fluxes and fermentative capacities that are characteristic for S. cerevisiae and essential for many of its industrial applications, and argues against gene dosage effects as a means for fixing minor glycolytic paralogs in the yeast genome. MG was carefully designed and constructed to provide a robust, prototrophic platform for quantitative studies, and is made available to the scientific community.},

abstract = {The mouse cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) is a translational regulator implicated in long-term memory maintenance. Invertebrate orthologs of CPEB3 in Aplysia and Drosophila are functional prions that are physiologically active in the aggregated state. To determine if this principle applies to the mammalian CPEB3, we expressed it in yeast and found that it forms heritable aggregates that are the hallmark of known prions. In addition, we confirm in the mouse the importance of CPEB3's prion formation for CPEB3 function. Interestingly, deletion analysis of the CPEB3 prion domain uncovered a tripartite organization: two aggregation-promoting domains surround a regulatory module that affects interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. In all, our data provide direct evidence that CPEB3 is a functional prion in the mammalian brain and underline the potential importance of an actin/CPEB3 feedback loop for the synaptic plasticity underlying the persistence of long-term memory.},

abstract = {Budding yeast begin the transition to quiescence by prolonging G1 and accumulating limited nutrients. They undergo asymmetric cell divisions, slow cellular expansion, acquire significant stress tolerance and construct elaborate cell walls. These morphological changes give rise to quiescent (Q) cells, which can be distinguished from three other cell types in a stationary phase culture by flow cytometry. We have used flow cytometry to screen for genes that are required to obtain the quiescent cell fraction. We find that cell wall integrity is critical and these genes may help define quiescence-specific features of the cell wall. Genes required to evade the host innate immune response are common. These may be new targets for antifungal drugs. Acquired thermo-tolerance is also a common property and we show that the stress-response transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 promote quiescence. Many other pathways also contribute, including a subset of genes involved in autophagy, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA replication, bud site selection and cytokinesis.},

abstract = {The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) aims to build 16 designer yeast chromosomes and combine them into a single yeast cell. To date one synthetic chromosome, synIII(1), and one synthetic chromosome arm, synIXR(2), have been constructed and their in vivo function validated in the absence of the corresponding wild type chromosomes. An important design feature of Sc2.0 chromosomes is the introduction of PCRTags, which are short, re-coded sequences within open reading frames (ORFs) that enable differentiation of synthetic chromosomes from their wild type counterparts. PCRTag primers anneal selectively to either synthetic or wild type chromosomes and the presence/absence of each type of DNA can be tested using a simple PCR assay. The standard readout of the PCRTag assay is to assess presence/absence of amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, with an average PCRTag amplicon density of one per 1.5 kb and a genome size of {\~{}}12 Mb, the completed Sc2.0 genome will encode roughly 8,000 PCRTags. To improve throughput, we have developed a real time PCR-based detection assay for PCRTag genotyping that we call qPCRTag analysis. The workflow specifies 500 nl reactions in a 1,536 multiwell plate, allowing us to test up to 768 PCRTags with both synthetic and wild type primer pairs in a single experiment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7{\%}. Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant detection and accuracy.

RESULTS: Sequence generated by Ion Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM, resulting in no coverage for approximately 30{\%} of the genome. We analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that from the Pacific Biosciences platform.

CONCLUSIONS: All three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate usable sequence. However there are key differences between the quality of that data and the applications it will support.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene co-expressions often determine module-defining spatial and temporal concurrences of proteins. Yet, little effort has been devoted to tracing coordinating signals for expression correlations to the three-dimensional structures of gene products.

RESULTS: We performed a global structure-based analysis of the yeast and human proteomes and contrasted this information against their respective transcriptome organizations obtained from comprehensive microarray data. We show that protein vulnerability quantifies dosage sensitivity for metabolic adaptation phases and tissue-specific patterns of mRNA expression, determining the extent of co-expression similarity of binding partners. The role of protein intrinsic disorder in transcriptome organization is also delineated by interrelating vulnerability, disorder propensity and co-expression patterns. Extremely vulnerable human proteins are shown to be subject to severe post-transcriptional regulation of their expression through significant micro-RNA targeting, making mRNA levels poor surrogates for protein-expression levels. By contrast, in yeast the expression of extremely under-wrapped proteins is likely regulated through protein aggregation. Thus, the 85 most vulnerable proteins in yeast include the five confirmed prions, while in human, the genes encoding extremely vulnerable proteins are predicted to be targeted by microRNAs. Hence, in both vastly different organisms protein vulnerability emerges as a structure-encoded signal for post-transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSION: Vulnerability of protein structure and the concurrent need to maintain structural integrity are shown to quantify dosage sensitivity, compelling gene expression patterns across tissue types and temporal adaptation phases in a quantifiable manner. Extremely vulnerable proteins impose additional constraints on gene expression: They are subject to high levels of regulation at the post-transcriptional level.},

abstract = {ARO4 and HIS7 are two tandemly orientated genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are transcribed into the same direction. The ARO4 terminator and the HIS7 promoter regions are sensitive to Micrococcus nuclease (Mnase) and separated by a positioned nucleosome. The HIS7 promoter is target for the transcription factors Gcn4p and Bas1p/Bas2p that activate its transcription upon amino acid starvation and purine limitation, respectively. Activation of the HIS7 gene by Gcn4p overexpression but not by Bas1p/Bas2p releases an ordered nucleosome distribution to yield increased Mnase sensitivity throughout the intergenic region. This remodeling is SNF2 dependent but mostly GCN5 independent. Accordingly, SNF2 is necessary for the Gcn4p-mediated transcriptional activation of the HIS7 gene. GCN5 is required for activation upon adenine limitation by Bas1p/Bas2p. Our data suggest that activation of HIS7 transcription by Gcn4p and Bas1p/Bas2p is supported by a nucleosome position-dependent and -independent mechanism, respectively. Whereas Gcn4p activation causes Swi/Snf-mediated remodeling of the nucleosomal architecture at the HIS7 promoter, the Bas1p/Bas2p complex presumably activates in combination with Gcn5p-dependent histone acetylation.},

For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, hybridization-based complexity analysis and SAGE analysis showed that the majority of yeast mRNAs are present at one or fewer copies per cell; however, neither method provides an accurate estimate of the full range of low abundance transcripts. Here we examine the range of intracellular transcript abundance in yeast using kinetically monitored, reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR (kRT-PCR). Steady-state transcript levels encoded by all 65 genes on the left arm of chromosome III and 185 transcription factor genes are quantitated. Abundant transcripts encoded by glycolytic genes, previously quantitated by kRT-PCR, are present at a few hundred copies per cell whereas genes encoding physiologically important transcription factors are expressed at levels as low as one-thousandth transcript per cell. Of the genes assessed, only the silent mating type loci, HML and HMR, are transcriptionally silent. The results show that transcript abundance in yeast varies over six orders of magnitude. Finally, kRT-PCR, cDNA microarray, and high density oligonucleotide array assays are compared for their ability to detect and quantitate the complete yeast transcriptome.},

abstract = {The characterization and public release of genome sequences from thousands of organisms is expanding the scope for genetic variation studies. However, understanding the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation remains a challenge in eukaryotes due to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype map. One approach to this is the intensive study of model systems for which diverse sources of information can be accumulated and integrated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an extensively studied model organism, with well-known protein functions and thoroughly curated phenotype data. To develop and expand the available resources linking genomic variation with function in yeast, we aim to model the pan-genome of S. cerevisiae. To initiate the yeast pan-genome, we newly sequenced or re-sequenced the genomes of 25 strains that are commonly used in the yeast research community using advanced sequencing technology at high quality. We also developed a pipeline for automated pan-genome analysis, which integrates the steps of assembly, annotation, and variation calling. To assign strain-specific functional annotations, we identified genes that were not present in the reference genome. We classified these according to their presence or absence across strains and characterized each group of genes with known functional and phenotypic features. The functional roles of novel genes not found in the reference genome and associated with strains or groups of strains appear to be consistent with anticipated adaptations in specific lineages. As more S. cerevisiae strain genomes are released, our analysis can be used to collate genome data and relate it to lineage-specific patterns of genome evolution. Our new tool set will enhance our understanding of genomic and functional evolution in S. cerevisiae, and will be available to the yeast genetics and molecular biology community.},

abstract = {The yeast translation termination factor Sup35p, by aggregating as the [PSI (+)] prion, enables ribosomes to read-through stop codons, thus expanding the diversity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. Yeast prions are functional amyloids that replicate by templating their conformation on native protein molecules, then assembling as large aggregates and fibers. Prions propagate epigenetically from mother to daughter cells by fragmentation of such assemblies. In the N-terminal prion-forming domain, Sup35p has glutamine/asparagine-rich oligopeptide repeats (OPRs), which enable propagation through chaperone-elicited shearing. We have engineered chimeras by replacing the polar OPRs in Sup35p by up to five repeats of a hydrophobic amyloidogenic sequence from the synthetic bacterial prionoid RepA-WH1. The resulting hybrid, [REP-PSI (+)], (i) was functional in a stop codon read-through assay in S. cerevisiae; (ii) generates weak phenotypic variants upon both its expression or transformation into [psi (-)] cells; (iii) these variants correlated with high molecular weight aggregates resistant to SDS during electrophoresis; and (iv) according to fluorescence microscopy, the fusion of the prion domains from the engineered chimeras to the reporter protein mCherry generated perivacuolar aggregate foci in yeast cells. All these are signatures of bona fide yeast prions. As assessed through biophysical approaches, the chimeras assembled as oligomers rather than as the fibers characteristic of [PSI (+)]. These results suggest that it is the balance between polar and hydrophobic residues in OPRs what determines prion conformational dynamics. In addition, our findings illustrate the feasibility of enabling new propagation traits in yeast prions by engineering OPRs with heterologous amyloidogenic sequence repeats.},

abstract = {In response to nitrogen starvation in the presence of a poor carbon source, diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo meiosis and package the haploid nuclei produced in meiosis into spores. The formation of spores requires an unusual cell division event in which daughter cells are formed within the cytoplasm of the mother cell. This process involves the de novo generation of two different cellular structures: novel membrane compartments within the cell cytoplasm that give rise to the spore plasma membrane and an extensive spore wall that protects the spore from environmental insults. This article summarizes what is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling spore assembly with particular attention to how constitutive cellular functions are modified to create novel behaviors during this developmental process. Key regulatory points on the sporulation pathway are also discussed as well as the possible role of sporulation in the natural ecology of S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Cell aggregation in unicellular organisms, induced by either cell non-sexual adhesion to yield flocs and biofilm, or pheromone-driving sexual conjugation is of great significance in cellular stress response, medicine, and brewing industries. Most current literatures have focused on one form of cell aggregation termed flocculation and its major molecular determinants, the flocculation (FLO) family genes. Here, we implemented a map-based approach for dissecting the molecular basis of non-sexual cell aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide mapping has identified four major quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying nature variation in the cell aggregation phenotype. High-resolution mapping following up with knockout and allele replacement experiments resolved the QTL into the underlying genes (AMN1, RGA1, FLO1, and FLO8) or even into the causative nucleotide. Genetic variation in the QTL genes can explain up to 46{\%} of phenotypic variation of this trait. Of these genes, AMN1 plays the leading role, differing from the FLO family members, in regulating expression of cell clumping phenotype through inducing cell segregation defect. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of how cell aggregation is regulated in budding yeast, and the data will be directly implicated to understand the molecular basis and evolutionary implications of cell aggregation in other fungus species.},

abstract = {Stabilization of the ribosomal complexes plays an important role in translational control. Mechanisms of ribosome stabilization have been studied in detail for initiation and elongation of eukaryotic translation, but almost nothing is known about stabilization of eukaryotic termination ribosomal complexes. Here, we present one of the mechanisms of fine-tuning of the translation termination process in eukaryotes. We show that certain deacylated tRNAs, remaining in the E site of the ribosome at the end of the elongation cycle, increase the stability of the termination and posttermination complexes. Moreover, only the part of eRF1 recognizing the stop codon is stabilized in the A site of the ribosome, and the stabilization is not dependent on the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA. The determinants, defining this property of the tRNA, reside in the acceptor stem. It was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of tRNA(Val) and construction of a mini-helix structure identical to the acceptor stem of tRNA. The mechanism of this stabilization is different from the fixation of the unrotated state of the ribosome by CCA end of tRNA or by cycloheximide in the E site. Our data allow to reveal the possible functions of the isodecoder tRNAs in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) are present in many eukaryotic genomes and are linked to genome instabilities and disease in humans. The mechanisms responsible for ITS-mediated genome instability are not understood in molecular detail. Here, we use a model Saccharomyces cerevisiae system to characterize genome instability mediated by yeast telomeric (Ytel) repeats embedded within an intron of a reporter gene inside a yeast chromosome. We observed a very high rate of small insertions and deletions within the repeats. We also found frequent gross chromosome rearrangements, including deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations, and formation of acentric minichromosomes. The inversions are a unique class of chromosome rearrangement involving an interaction between the ITS and the true telomere of the chromosome. Because we previously found that Ytel repeats cause strong replication fork stalling, we suggest that formation of double-stranded DNA breaks within the Ytel sequences might be responsible for these gross chromosome rearrangements.},

abstract = {Large-scale genome rearrangements have been observed in cells adapting to various selective conditions during laboratory evolution experiments. However, it remains unclear whether these types of mutations can be stably maintained in populations and how they impact the evolutionary trajectories. Here we show that chromosomal rearrangements contribute to extremely high copper tolerance in a set of natural yeast strains isolated from Evolution Canyon (EC), Israel. The chromosomal rearrangements in EC strains result in segmental duplications in chromosomes 7 and 8, which increase the copy number of genes involved in copper regulation, including the crucial transcriptional activator CUP2 and the metallothionein CUP1. The copy number of CUP2 is correlated with the level of copper tolerance, indicating that increasing dosages of a single transcriptional activator by chromosomal rearrangements has a profound effect on a regulatory pathway. By gene expression analysis and functional assays, we identified three previously unknown downstream targets of CUP2: PHO84, SCM4, and CIN2, all of which contributed to copper tolerance in EC strains. Finally, we conducted an evolution experiment to examine how cells maintained these changes in a fluctuating environment. Interestingly, the rearranged chromosomes were reverted back to the wild-type configuration at a high frequency and the recovered chromosome became fixed in less selective conditions. Our results suggest that transposon-mediated chromosomal rearrangements can be highly dynamic and can serve as a reversible mechanism during early stages of adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in laboratory experiments for over a century and has been instrumental in understanding virtually every aspect of molecular biology and genetics. However, it wasn't until a decade ago that the scientific community started to realise how little was known about this yeast's ecology and natural history, and how this information was vitally important for interpreting its biology. Recent large-scale population genomics studies coupled with intensive field surveys have revealed a previously unappreciated wild lifestyle of S. cerevisiae outside the restrictions of human environments and laboratories. The recent discovery that Chinese isolates harbour almost twice as much genetic variation as isolates from the rest of the world combined suggests that Asia is the likely origin of the modern budding yeast.

abstract = {We have developed a large-scale screen to identify genes expressed at different times during the life cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to determine the subcellular locations of many of the encoded gene products. Diploid yeast strains containing random lacZ insertions throughout the genome have been constructed by transformation with a mutagenized genomic library. Twenty-eight hundred transformants containing fusion genes expressed during vegetative growth and 55 transformants containing meiotically induced fusion genes have been identified. Based on the frequency of transformed strains producing beta-galactosidase, we estimate that 80-86{\%} of the yeast genome (excluding the rDNA) contains open reading frames expressed in vegetative cells and that there are 93-135 meiotically induced genes. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of 2373 strains carrying fusion genes expressed in vegetative cells has identified 245 fusion proteins that localize to discrete locations in the cell, including the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic dots, spindle pole body, and microtubules. The DNA sequence adjacent to the lacZ gene has been determined for 91 vegetative fusion genes whose products have been localized and for 43 meiotically induced fusions. Although most fusions represent genes unidentified previously, many correspond to known genes, including some whose expression has not been studied previously and whose products have not been localized. For example, Sec21-beta-gal fusion proteins yield a Golgi-like staining pattern, Ty1-beta-gal fusion proteins localize to cytoplasmic dots, and the meiosis-specific Mek1/Mre4-beta-gal and Spo11-beta-gal fusion proteins reside in the nucleus. The phenotypes in haploid cells have been analyzed for 59 strains containing chromosomal fusion genes expressed during vegetative growth; 9 strains fail to form colonies indicating that the disrupted genes are essential. Fifteen additional strains display slow growth or are impaired for growth on specific media or in the presence of inhibitors. Of 39 meiotically induced fusion genes examined, 14 disruptions confer defects in spore formation or spore viability in homozygous diploids. Our results will allow researchers who identify a yeast gene to determine immediately whether that gene is expressed at a specific time during the life cycle and whether its gene product localizes to a specific subcellular location.},

A network based on genetic interaction profiles reveals a functional map of the cell in which genes of similar biological processes cluster together in coherent subsets, and highly correlated profiles delineate specific pathways to define gene function. The global network identifies functional cross-connections between all bioprocesses, mapping a cellular wiring diagram of pleiotropy.

@article{Kuzmin2014,
abstract = {Genetic interactions occur when mutant alleles of two or more genes collaborate to generate an unusual composite phenotype, one that would not be predicted based on the expected combined effects of the individual mutant alleles. Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) methodology was developed to automate yeast genetic analysis and enable systematic genetic interaction studies. In its simplest form, SGA consists of a series of replica pinning steps, which enable the construction of haploid double mutants through mating and meiotic recombination. For example, a strain carrying a query mutation, such as a deletion allele of a nonessential gene or a conditional temperature sensitive allele of an essential gene, could be crossed to an input array of yeast mutants, such as the complete set of {\~{}}5,000 viable deletion mutants, to generate an output array of double mutants, that can be scored for genetic interactions based on estimates of cellular fitness derived from colony-size measurements. A simple quantitative measure of genetic interactions can be derived from colony size, which serves as a proxy for fitness. Furthermore, SGA can be applied in a variety of other contexts, such as Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL), in which a query mutation is crossed into an array of yeast strains, each of which overexpresses a different gene, thus making use of SGA to probe for gain-of-function phenotypes in specific genetic backgrounds. High-Content Screening (HCS) also integrates SGA to perform genome-wide screens for quantitative analysis of morphological phenotypes or pathway activity based upon fluorescent markers, extending genetic interaction analysis beyond fitness-based measurements. Genetic interaction studies offer insight into gene function, pathway structure, and buffering, and thus a complete genetic interaction network of yeast will generate a global functional wiring diagram for a eukaryotic cell.},

Genome-wide analyses enabled the extraction of the genes and identification of the functional categories for which genetic perturbation caused the change of growth behaviour. Statistical analyses revealed defective growth for 646 deletion and 1302 overexpression strains. We classified these deleted and overexpressed genes into known functional categories, and identified several functional categories having fragility and robustness for cellular growth. We also screened the deletion and overexpression strains that exhibited a significantly higher growth rate than the strain without genetic perturbation, and found that three deletion and two overexpression strains were high-growth strains. The genes and functional categories identified in the analysis might provide useful information on designing industrially useful yeast strains.},

@article{Picotti2013,
abstract = {Experience from different fields of life sciences suggests that accessible, complete reference maps of the components of the system under study are highly beneficial research tools. Examples of such maps include libraries of the spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them, constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97{\%} of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun) and the other supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted) proteomic measurements. Together, the two versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the levels of related proteins. Our results suggest that selective pressure favours the acquisition of sets of polymorphisms that adapt protein levels but also maintain the stoichiometry of functionally related pathway members.},

In an effort to overcome these problems, several groups have successfully demonstrated the viability of the whole-genome random 'shotgun' method in large-scale sequencing of both viruses and prokaryotes. Here we report the sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX, determined in part by a whole-chromosome 'shotgun', and describe the particular difficulties encountered in the random 'shotgun' sequencing of an entire eukaryotic chromosome. Analysis of this sequence shows that chromosome IX contains 221 open reading frames (ORFs), of which approximately 30{\%} have been sequenced previously.

In 1993, a team of 20 European laboratories began the systematic sequence analysis of chromosome XIV. The completed and intensively checked final sequence of 784,328 base pairs was released in April, 1996. Substantial parts had been published before or had previously been made available on request. The sequence contained 419 known or presumptive protein-coding genes, including two pseudogenes and three retrotransposons, 14 tRNA genes, and three small nuclear RNA genes. For 116 (30{\%}) protein-coding sequences, one or more structural homologues were identified elsewhere in the yeast genome. Half of them belong to duplicated groups of 6-14 loosely linked genes, in most cases with conserved gene order and orientation (relaxed interchromosomal synteny).

One hundred and eighteen ORFs (31{\%}) correspond to genes previously identified in S. cerevisiae. All other ORFs represent novel putative yeast genes, whose function will have to be determined experimentally. However, 57 of the latter subset (another 15{\%} of the total) encode proteins that show significant analogy to proteins of known function from yeast or other organisms. The remaining ORFs, exhibiting no significant similarity to any known sequence, amount to 54{\%} of the total. General features of chromosome X are also reported, with emphasis on the nucleotide frequency distribution in the environment of the ATG and stop codons, the possible coding capacity of at least some of the small ORFs (<100 codons) and the significance of 46 non-canonical or unpaired nucleotides in the stems of some of the 24 tRNA genes recognized on this chromosome.},

abstract = {In the framework of the EU genome-sequencing programmes, the complete DNA sequence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome II (807 188 bp) has been determined. At present, this is the largest eukaryotic chromosome entirely sequenced. A total of 410 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, covering 72{\%} of the sequence. Similarity searches revealed that 124 ORFs (30{\%}) correspond to genes of known function, 51 ORFs (12.5{\%}) appear to be homologues of genes whose functions are known, 52 others (12.5{\%}) have homologues the functions of which are not well defined and another 33 of the novel putative genes (8{\%}) exhibit a degree of similarity which is insufficient to confidently assign function. Of the genes on chromosome II, 37-45{\%} are thus of unpredicted function. Among the novel putative genes, we found several that are related to genes that perform differentiated functions in multicellular organisms of are involved in malignancy. In addition to a compact arrangement of potential protein coding sequences, the analysis of this chromosome confirmed general chromosome patterns but also revealed particular novel features of chromosomal organization. Alternating regional variations in average base composition correlate with variations in local gene density along chromosome II, as observed in chromosomes XI and III. We propose that functional ARS elements are preferably located in the AT-rich regions that have a spacing of approximately 110 kb. Similarly, the 13 tRNA genes and the three Ty elements of chromosome II are found in AT-rich regions. In chromosome II, the distribution of coding sequences between the two strands is biased, with a ratio of 1.3:1. An interesting aspect regarding the evolution of the eukaryotic genome is the finding that chromosome II has a high degree of internal genetic redundancy, amounting to 16{\%} of the coding capacity.},

abstract = {Chromosome I from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a DNA molecule of approximately 231 kbp and is the smallest naturally occurring functional eukaryotic nuclear chromosome so far characterized. The nucleotide sequence of this chromosome has been determined as part of an international collaboration to sequence the entire yeast genome. The chromosome contains 89 open reading frames and 4 tRNA genes. The central 165 kbp of the chromosome resembles other large sequenced regions of the yeast genome in both its high density and distribution of genes. In contrast, the remaining sequences flanking this DNA that comprise the two ends of the chromosome and make up more than 25{\%} of the DNA molecule have a much lower gene density, are largely not transcribed, contain no genes essential for vegetative growth, and contain several apparent pseudogenes and a 15-kbp redundant sequence. These terminally repetitive regions consist of a telomeric repeat called W', flanked by DNA closely related to the yeast FLO1 gene. The low gene density, presence of pseudogenes, and lack of expression are consistent with the idea that these terminal regions represent the yeast equivalent of heterochromatin. The occurrence of such a high proportion of DNA with so little information suggests that its presence gives this chromosome the critical length required for proper function.},

It is the third-largest yeast chromosome after chromosomes XII and IV, and is very similar in size to chromosome VII. It alone represents 9{\%} of the yeast genome (8{\%} if ribosomal DNA is included). When systematic sequencing of chromosome XV was started, 93 genes or markers were identified, and most of them were mapped. However, very little else was known about chromosome XV which, in contrast to shorter chromosomes, had not been the object of comprehensive genetic or molecular analysis. It was therefore decided to start sequencing chromosome XV only in the third phase of the European Yeast Genome Sequencing Programme, after experience was gained on chromosomes III, XI and II. The sequence of chromosome XV has been determined from a set of partly overlapping cosmid clones derived from a unique yeast strain, and physically mapped at 3.3-kilobase resolution before sequencing. As well as numerous new open reading frames (ORFs) and genes encoding tRNA or small RNA molecules, the sequence of 1,091,283 base pairs confirms the high proportion of orphan genes and reveals a number of ancestral and successive duplications with other yeast chromosomes.},

Apart from the smaller chromosomes, which can have substantially lower gene density in their telomeric regions, there is a consistent average of one open reading frame (ORF) approximately every two kilobases. However, one of the most surprising findings for a eukaryote with approximately 6,000 genes was the amount of apparent redundancy in its genome. This redundancy occurs both between individual ORFs and over more extensive chromosome regions, which have been duplicated preserving gene order and orientation. Here we report the entire nucleotide sequence of chromosome XIII, the sixth-largest S. cerevisiae chromosome, and demonstrate that its features and organization are consistent with those observed for other S. cerevisiae chromosomes.

Unfortunately, it is incompatible with all the various specialized plasmids currently used in microbiology and biomedical research laboratories, and is therefore, not widely adopted. In an effort to dramatically improve the versatility of yeast gap-repair cloning and make it compatible with any DNA plasmid, we demonstrate that by simply including a yeast-cloning cassette (YCC) that contains the 2-micron origin of replication (2$\mu$m ori) and the ura3 gene for selection, multiple DNA fragments can be assembled into any DNA vector. We show this has almost unlimited potential by building a variety of plasmid for different uses including: recombinant protein production, epitope tagging, site-directed mutagenesis, and expression of fluorescent fusion proteins. We demonstrate the use in a variety of plasmids for use in microbial systems and even demonstrate it can be used in a vertebrate model. This method is remarkably simple and extremely efficient, plus it provides a significant cost saving over commercially available kits.},

Many studies have focused on the regulatory role of transcription factor-binding sites. Here, we explore the transcriptional effects of different elements, nucleosome-disfavoring sequences and, specifically, poly(dA:dT) tracts that are highly prevalent in eukaryotic promoters. By measuring promoter activity for a large-scale promoter library, designed with systematic manipulations to the properties and spatial arrangement of poly(dA:dT) tracts, we show that these tracts significantly and causally affect transcription. We show that manipulating these elements offers a general genetic mechanism, applicable to promoters regulated by different transcription factors, for tuning expression in a predictable manner, with resolution that can be even finer than that attained by altering transcription factor sites. Overall, our results advance the understanding of the regulatory code and suggest a potential mechanism by which promoters yielding prespecified expression patterns can be designed.},

abstract = {Despite extensive research, our understanding of the rules according to which cis-regulatory sequences are converted into gene expression is limited. We devised a method for obtaining parallel, highly accurate gene expression measurements from thousands of designed promoters and applied it to measure the effect of systematic changes in the location, number, orientation, affinity and organization of transcription-factor binding sites and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Our analyses reveal a clear relationship between expression and binding-site multiplicity, as well as dependencies of expression on the distance between transcription-factor binding sites and gene starts which are transcription-factor specific, including a striking ∼10-bp periodic relationship between gene expression and binding-site location. We show how this approach can measure transcription-factor sequence specificities and the sensitivity of transcription-factor sites to the surrounding sequence context, and compare the activity of 75 yeast transcription factors. Our method can be used to study both cis and trans effects of genotype on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational control.},

abstract = {TRIPLES is a web-accessible database of TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae-a relational database housing nearly half a million data points generated from an ongoing study using large-scale transposon mutagenesis to characterize gene function in yeast. At present, TRIPLES contains three principal data sets (i.e. phenotypic data, protein localization data and expression data) for over 3500 annotated yeast genes as well as several hundred non-annotated open reading frames. In addition, the TRIPLES web site provides online order forms linked to each data set so that users may request any strain or reagent generated from this project free of charge. In response to user requests, the TRIPLES web site has undergone several recent modifications. Our localization data have been supplemented with approximately 500 fluorescent micrographs depicting actual staining patterns observed upon indirect immunofluorescence analysis of indicated epitope-tagged proteins. These localization data, as well as all other data sets within TRIPLES, are now available in full as tab-delimited text. To accommodate increased reagent requests, all orders are now cataloged in a separate database, and users are notified immediately of order receipt and shipment. Also, TRIPLES is one of five sites incorporated into the new functional analysis tool Function Junction provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database. TRIPLES may be accessed from the Yale Genome Analysis Center (YGAC) homepage at http://ygac.med.yale.edu.},

abstract = {Determining the effect of gene deletion is a fundamental approach to understanding gene function. Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96{\%} of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7{\%} of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

Because the homology between commonly used auxotrophic marker gene segments and genomic sequences has been largely or completely abolished, these strains will also reduce plasmid integration events which can interfere with a wide variety of molecular genetic applications.

The minichromosomes are mitotically stable plasmids, each of which contains a different ARS (autonomously replicating sequence), a centrometeric sequence, CEN5, and two yeast genes, LEU2 and URA3. Forty minichromosome maintenance-defective (Mcm-) mutants were characterized. They constitute 16 complementation groups. These mutants can be divided into two classes, specific and nonspecific, by their differential ability to maintain minichromosomes with different ARSs. The specific class of mutants is defective only in the maintenance of minichromosomes that carry a particular group of ARSs irrespective of the centromeric sequence present. The nonspecific class of mutants is defective in the maintenance of all minichromosomes tested irrespective of the ARS or centromeric sequence present. The specific class may include mutants that do not initiate DNA replication effectively at specific ARSs present on the minichromosomes; the nonspecific class may include mutants that are affected in the segregation and/or replication of circular plasmids in general.},

Regions fo homology within the sequences upstream from the initiation codon and those following the termination codon have been detected between the yeast iso-1-cytochrome c gene and the actin gene. As deduced from the nucleotide sequence, yeast actin has 374 amino acid residues. Its primary structure, especially the NH2-terminal third of the protein, is highly conserved during evolution.},

It covered not only Mendelism but evolution, natural selection, biometry, mutation, and cytology. It ran to five editions but was, despite its success, largely forgotten following Lock's early death in 1915. Nevertheless it was the book that inspired H. J. Muller to do genetics and was remembered by A. H. Sturtevant as the source of the earliest suggestion that linkage might be related to the exchange of parts between homologous chromosomes. Here we also put forward evidence that it had a major influence on the statistician and geneticist R. A. Fisher at the time he was a mathematics student at Cambridge.},

@article{Perez-Traves2014,
abstract = {Although the genus Saccharomyces has been thoroughly studied, some species in the genus has not yet been accurately resolved; an example is S. bayanus, a taxon that includes genetically diverse lineages of pure and hybrid strains. This diversity makes the assignation and classification of strains belonging to this species unclear and controversial. They have been subdivided by some authors into two varieties (bayanus and uvarum), which have been raised to the species level by others. In this work, we evaluate the complexity of 46 different strains included in the S. bayanus taxon by means of PCR-RFLP analysis and by sequencing of 34 gene regions and one mitochondrial gene. Using the sequence data, and based on the S. bayanus var. bayanus reference strain NBRC 1948, a hypothetical pure S. bayanus was reconstructed for these genes that showed alleles with similarity values lower than 97{\%} with the S. bayanus var. uvarum strain CBS 7001, and of 99-100{\%} with the non S. cerevisiae portion in S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 and with the new species S. eubayanus. Among the S. bayanus strains under study, different levels of homozygosity, hybridization and introgression were found; however, no pure S. bayanus var. bayanus strain was identified. These S. bayanus hybrids can be classified into two types: homozygous (type I) and heterozygous hybrids (type II), indicating that they have been originated by different hybridization processes. Therefore, a putative evolutionary scenario involving two different hybridization events between a S. bayanus var. uvarum and unknown European S. eubayanus-like strains can be postulated to explain the genomic diversity observed in our S. bayanus var. bayanus strains.},

It provides for an enormously wide variety of genome modifications via homologous recombination. Exceptional high frequencies of mutations are reached when a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) is induced within the locus targeted by the synthetic oligonucleotides. Presented in this chapter is an in-depth description of a series of applications of the delitto perfetto strategy for mutagenesis and chromosome modification both with and without the induction of a DSB, along with the procedures and materials.},

abstract = {Whole genome sequencing has allowed rapid progress in the application of forward genetics in model species. In this study, we demonstrated an application of next-generation sequencing for forward genetics in a complex crop genome. We sequenced an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant of Sorghum bicolor defective in hydrogen cyanide release and identified the causal mutation. A workflow identified the causal polymorphism relative to the reference BTx623 genome by integrating data from single nucleotide polymorphism identification, prior information about candidate gene(s) implicated in cyanogenesis, mutation spectra, and polymorphisms likely to affect phenotypic changes. A point mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in the coding sequence of dhurrinase2, which encodes a protein involved in the dhurrin catabolic pathway, was responsible for the acyanogenic phenotype. Cyanogenic glucosides are not cyanogenic compounds but their cyanohydrins derivatives do release cyanide. The mutant accumulated the glucoside, dhurrin, but failed to efficiently release cyanide upon tissue disruption. Thus, we tested the effects of cyanide release on insect herbivory in a genetic background in which accumulation of cyanogenic glucoside is unchanged. Insect preference choice experiments and herbivory measurements demonstrate a deterrent effect of cyanide release capacity, even in the presence of wild-type levels of cyanogenic glucoside accumulation. Our gene cloning method substantiates the value of (1) a sequenced genome, (2) a strongly penetrant and easily measurable phenotype, and (3) a workflow to pinpoint a causal mutation in crop genomes and accelerate in the discovery of gene function in the postgenomic era.},

Readthrough of a PTC allows ribosomal A-site insertion of a near-cognate tRNA, leading to synthesis of a full-length protein from otherwise defective mRNA. To understand the mechanism of such nonsense suppression, we developed a yeast system that allows purification and sequence analysis of full-length readthrough products arising as a consequence of endogenous readthrough or the compromised termination fidelity attributable to the loss of Upf (up-frameshift) factors, defective release factors, or the presence of the aminoglycoside gentamicin. Unlike classical "wobble" models, our analyses showed that three of four possible near-cognate tRNAs could mispair at position 1 or 3 of nonsense codons and that, irrespective of whether readthrough is endogenous or induced, the same sets of amino acids are inserted. We identified the insertion of Gln, Tyr, and Lys at UAA and UAG, whereas Trp, Arg, and Cys were inserted at UGA, and the frequency of insertion of individual amino acids was distinct for specific nonsense codons and readthrough-inducing agents. Our analysis suggests that the use of genetic or chemical means to increase readthrough does not promote novel or alternative mispairing events; rather, readthrough effectors cause quantitative enhancement of endogenous mistranslation events. Knowledge of the amino acids incorporated during readthrough not only elucidates the decoding process but also may allow predictions of the functionality of readthrough protein products.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are heritable protein-based elements, most of which are formed of amyloid aggregates that rely on the action of molecular chaperones for transmission to progeny. Prions can form distinct amyloid structures, known as 'strains' in mammalian systems, that dictate both pathological progression and cross-species infection barriers. In yeast these same amyloid structural polymorphisms, called 'variants', dictate the intensity of prion-associated phenotypes and stability in mitosis. We recently reported that [PSI(+)] prion variants differ in the fundamental domain requirements for one chaperone, the Hsp40/J-protein Sis1, which are mutually exclusive between two different yeast prions, demonstrating a functional plurality for Sis1. (1) Here we extend that analysis to incorporate additional data that collectively support the hypothesis that Sis1 has multiple functional roles that can be accomplished by distinct sets of domains. These functions are differentially required by distinct prions and prion variants. We also present new data regarding Hsp104-mediated prion elimination and show that some Sis1 functions, but not all, are conserved in the human homolog Hdj1/DNAJB1. Importantly, of the ten amyloid-based prions indentified to date in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the chaperone requirements of only four are known, leaving a great diversity of amyloid structures, and likely modes of amyloid-chaperone interaction, largely unexplored.},

abstract = {Despite the greater functional importance of protein levels, our knowledge of gene expression evolution is based almost entirely on studies of mRNA levels. In contrast, our understanding of how translational regulation evolves has lagged far behind. Here we have applied ribosome profiling--which measures both global mRNA levels and their translation rates--to two species of Saccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the relative contributions of changes in mRNA abundance and translation to regulatory evolution. We report that both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35{\%} of genes. The majority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in mRNA abundance, suggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory levels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting on several yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing selection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover multiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between species. Our analysis reveals the underappreciated complexity of post-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the search for the locus of selection into the binary categories of "coding" versus "regulatory" may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple regulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.},

abstract = {Multiple yeast prions have been identified that result from the structural conversion of proteins into a self-propagating amyloid form. Amyloid-based prion activity in yeast requires a series of discrete steps. First, the prion protein must form an amyloid nucleus that can recruit and structurally convert additional soluble proteins. Subsequently, maintenance of the prion during cell division requires fragmentation of these aggregates to create new heritable propagons. For the yeast prion protein Sup35, these different activities are encoded for by different regions of Sup35's prion domain. An N-terminal glutamine/asparagine-rich nucleation domain is required for nucleation and fiber growth, while an adjacent oligopeptide repeat domain is largely dispensable for prion nucleation and fiber growth, but required for chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. Although prion activity of glutamine/asparagine-rich proteins is predominantly determined by amino acid composition, the nucleation and oligopeptide repeat domains of Sup35 have distinct compositional requirements. Here, we quantitatively define these compositional requirements in vivo. We show that aromatic residues strongly promote both prion formation and chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. By contrast, non-aromatic hydrophobic residues strongly promote prion formation, but inhibit prion propagation. These results provide insight into why some aggregation-prone proteins are unable to propagate as prions.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are superb models for understanding the mechanisms of self-perpetuating protein aggregates formation. [PSI(+) ] stands among the most documented yeast prions and results from self-assembly of the translation termination factor Sup35p into protein fibrils. A plethora of cellular factors were shown to affect [PSI(+) ] formation and propagation. Clearance of Sup35p prion particles is however poorly understood and documented. Here, we investigated the role of the proteasome in the degradation of Sup35p and in [PSI(+) ] prion propagation. We found that cells lacking the RPN4 gene, which have reduced intracellular proteasome pools, accumulated Sup35p and have defects in [PSI(+) ] formation and propagation. Sup35p is degraded in vitro by the 26S and 20S proteasomes in a ubiquitin-independent manner, generating an array of amyloidogenic peptides derived from its prion-domain. We also demonstrate the formation of a proteasome-resistant fragment spanning residues 83-685 which is devoid of the prion-domain that is essential for [PSI(+) ] propagation. Most important was the finding that the 26S and 20S proteasomes degrade Sup35p fibrils in vitro and abolish their infectivity. Our results point to an overlooked role of the proteasome in clearing toxic protein aggregates, and have important implications for a better understanding of the life cycle of infectious protein assemblies.},

Indeed, prion strain ensembles can evolve in response to environmental challenges, which makes them highly challenging drug targets. It is not understood how the proteostasis network amplifies one prion strain at the expense of another. Here, we demonstrate that Hsp104 remodels the distinct intermolecular contacts of different synthetic Sup35 prion strains in a way that selectively amplifies prions encoding strong [PSI(+)] and simultaneously eliminates prions encoding weak [PSI(+)]. Hsp104 has reduced ability to fragment prions encoding weak [PSI(+)], but readily converts them to nontemplating forms. By contrast, Hsp104 readily fragments prions encoding strong [PSI(+)], but has reduced ability to eliminate their infectivity. Thus, we illuminate direct mechanisms underpinning how the proteostasis network can drive prion strain selection.},

However, while these amyloidogenic pathways are linked to the emergence of new phenotypes, numerous studies have uncoupled the accumulation of aggregates from their biological consequences, revealing currently underappreciated complexity in the determination of these traits. Here, to explore the molecular basis of protein-only phenotypes, we focused on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35/[PSI(+)] prion, which confers a translation termination defect and expression level-dependent toxicity in its amyloid form. Our studies reveal that aggregated Sup35 retains its normal function as a translation release factor. However, fluctuations in the composition and size of these complexes specifically alter the level of this aggregate-associated activity and thereby the severity and toxicity of the amyloid state. Thus, amyloid heterogeneity is a crucial contributor to protein-only phenotypes.},

Но: нужно связывание с Sup45. Связывается ли Sup35 и Sup45 в клетках [PSI+]?
Данные (и выводы из) предыдущих исследований не согласуются друг с другом: да (28, 29) или нет (19, 30, 31). Но всё это фракционирование, т.е. непрямое определение. Впрочем, прямое определение затруднено тем, что не весь Sup35 находится в составе агрегатов.
Разработали (раньше) систему: PrD-HA, который связывается с Sup35 только в [PSI+] (figure 1A); Sup45 так вытащить можно, но только в [PSI+] (figure 1A)
1B: рибосомы тоже вытаскиваются (обратная транскрипция с праймерами к рРНК) и тоже только в [PSI+]
В штамме без N-домена Sup35 рибосомы таким способом не вытащить (тоже 1B).
1C: градиент сахарозы. В [PSI+] тяжелее (что, правда?). Обработка РНКазой ничего не меняла. Значит, дело в изменении подвижности Sup35, а не в рибосомах.
В то же время, в [psi-] Sup35 исчезал из осадка при обработке РНКазой. Следовательно, это фракция, ассоциированная с рибосомами.
Ок, похоже, что Sup35 взаимодействует со своими функциональными партнёрами в ПСИ+. Но как это влияет на эффективность терминации?

        

        
Попробовали оценить связь между количеством растворимого суп35 и эффективностью терминации (нонсенс-репортер, GST(UGA)dsRed-NLS). 
Рисунок 2А. Эффективность терминации начала падать только при уменьшении количества до 40{\%}. После этого падает линейно. В этой системе пси- оказался в точности на кривой, а вот ПСИ+ от неё ощутимо отошёл в сторону большей эффективности терминации -- следовательно, в нём есть ещё какая-то активность Суп35. 
Рисунок 2б: а если сделать ПСИ+ с регулируемым Суп35 в качестве единственного источника Суп35, то в нём падает количество обеих форм белка во времени, однако их соотношение ещё долго сохраняется. При этом эффективность терминации начинает падать только после полутора поколений. 
Вариант подхода с другой стороны: промоторы, специфичные к типу спаривания, и скрестили. пси- после такого издевательства выживали в течение примерно 7 поколений, ПСИ+ примерно так же. Если добавлять ГГХ, то выживание пси- сокращается примерно на два поколения, а ПСИ+ -- в два раза.

        

        
Как всё это связано с токсичностью? Есть варианты ПСИ, которые не токсичны сами по себе, но становятся токсичными при сверхэкспрессии Суп35 или его прионного домена. Ввели плазмиду, дающую примерно 1.3 единицы сверхэкспрессии прионного домена. Количество растворимого Суп35 особо не изменилось (кстати, антитела??). (3А). Для проверки более сильной сверхэкспрессии сделали штамм с полноразмерным под собственным промотором и C-доменом под доксициклиновым промотором. Затрансформировали урацилово-лейциновой плазмидой с прионным доменом. 10х сверхэкспрессия приводила к 2х снижению. При сильной сверхэкспрессии похоже.

        

        
Токсичность? Оба варианта сверхэкспрессии влияют на эффективность терминации, хотя только высококопийная влияет на уровень полноразмерного и только она токсична. 
Изменение скорости образования агрегатов? Связь с рибосомами? В той же системе количество растворимого Суп35 изменялось только при сильной сверхэкспрессии прионного домена. Добавление одной копии не меняло размер агрегатов, но сверхэкспрессия (любая) меняла. 

        

        
5: обратная корреляция между размером агрегатов и эффективностью терминации, а также между размером агрегатов и иммунопреципитации к прионному домену-HA. 

        

        
6: Математическая модель: получается то же самое.

abstract = {The question of how genetic variation in a population influences phenotypic variation and evolution is of major importance in modern biology. Yet much is still unknown about the relative functional importance of different forms of genome variation and how they are shaped by evolutionary processes. Here we address these questions by population level sequencing of 42 strains from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its closest relative S. paradoxus. We find that genome content variation, in the form of presence or absence as well as copy number of genetic material, is higher within S. cerevisiae than within S. paradoxus, despite genetic distances as measured in single-nucleotide polymorphisms being vastly smaller within the former species. This genome content variation, as well as loss-of-function variation in the form of premature stop codons and frameshifting indels, is heavily enriched in the subtelomeres, strongly reinforcing the relevance of these regions to functional evolution. Genes affected by these likely functional forms of variation are enriched for functions mediating interaction with the external environment (sugar transport and metabolism, flocculation, metal transport, and metabolism). Our results and analyses provide a comprehensive view of genomic diversity in budding yeast and expose surprising and pronounced differences between the variation within S. cerevisiae and that within S. paradoxus. We also believe that the sequence data and de novo assemblies will constitute a useful resource for further evolutionary and population genomics studies.},

abstract = {The vast majority of wine fermentations are performed principally by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, there are a growing number of instances in which other species of Saccharomyces play a predominant role. Interestingly, the presence of these other yeast species generally occurs via the formation of interspecific hybrids that contain genomic contributions from both S. cerevisiae and non-S. cerevisiae species. However, despite the large number of wine strains that are characterized at the genomic level, there remains limited information regarding the detailed genomic structure of hybrids used in winemaking. To address this, we describe the genome sequence of the thiol-releasing commercial wine yeast hybrid VIN7. VIN7 is shown to be an almost complete allotriploid interspecific hybrid that is comprised of a heterozygous diploid complement of S. cerevisiae chromosomes and a haploid Saccharomyces kudriavzevii genomic contribution. Both parental strains appear to be of European origin, with the S. cerevisiae parent being closely related to, but distinct from, the commercial wine yeasts QA23 and EC1118. In addition, several instances of chromosomal rearrangement between S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii sequences were observed that may mark the early stages of hybrid genome consolidation.},

abstract = {Although homologous recombination is an important pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in mitotically dividing eukaryotic cells, these events can also have negative consequences, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of deleterious mutations. We mapped about 140 spontaneous reciprocal crossovers on the right arm of the yeast chromosome IV using single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) microarrays. Our mapping and subsequent experiments demonstrate that inverted repeats of Ty retrotransposable elements are mitotic recombination hotspots. We found that the mitotic recombination maps on the two homologs were substantially different and were unrelated to meiotic recombination maps. Additionally, about 70{\%} of the DNA lesions that result in LOH are likely generated during G1 of the cell cycle and repaired during S or G2. We also show that different genetic elements are associated with reciprocal crossover conversion tracts depending on the cell cycle timing of the initiating DSB.},

abstract = {The amount of biomedical literature has been increasing rapidly during the last decade. Text mining techniques can harness this large-scale data, shed light onto complex drug mechanisms, and extract relation information that can support computational polypharmacology. In this work, we introduce a fully corpus-based and unsupervised method which utilizes the MEDLINE indexed titles and abstracts to infer drug gene associations and assist drug repositioning. The method measures the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between biomedical terms derived from the Gene Ontology and the Medical Subject Headings. Based on the PMI scores, drug and gene profiles are generated and candidate drug gene associations are inferred when computing the relatedness of their profiles. Results show that an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of up to 0.88 can be achieved. The method can successfully identify direct drug gene associations with high precision and prioritize them. Validation shows that the statistically derived profiles from literature perform as good as manually curated profiles. In addition, we examine the potential application of our approach towards drug repositioning. For all FDA approved drugs repositioned over the last 5years, we generate profiles from publications before 2009 and show that new indications rank high in the profiles. In summary, literature mined profiles can accurately predict drug gene associations and provide insights onto potential repositioning cases.},

@article{Elsik2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We wished to produce a single reference gene set for honey bee (Apis mellifera). Our motivation was twofold. First, we wished to obtain an improved set of gene models with increased coverage of known genes, while maintaining gene model quality. Second, we wished to provide a single official gene list that the research community could further utilize for consistent and comparable analyses and functional annotation.

RESULTS: We created a consensus gene set for honey bee (Apis mellifera) using GLEAN, a new algorithm that uses latent class analysis to automatically combine disparate gene prediction evidence in the absence of known genes. The consensus gene models had increased representation of honey bee genes without sacrificing quality compared with any one of the input gene predictions. When compared with manually annotated gold standards, the consensus set of gene models was similar or superior in quality to each of the input sets.

CONCLUSION: Most eukaryotic genome projects produce multiple gene sets because of the variety of gene prediction programs. Each of the gene prediction programs has strengths and weaknesses, and so the multiplicity of gene sets offers users a more comprehensive collection of genes to use than is available from a single program. On the other hand, the availability of multiple gene sets is also a cause for uncertainty among users as regards which set they should use. GLEAN proved to be an effective method to combine gene lists into a single reference set.},

@article{Tangsombatvichit2015,
abstract = {The ability to rapidly respond to nutrient changes is a fundamental requirement for cell survival. Here, we show that the zinc cluster regulator Znf1 responds to altered nutrient signals following glucose starvation through the direct control of genes involved in non-fermentative metabolism, including those belonged to the central pathways of gluconeogenesis (PCK1, FBP1 and MDH2), glyoxylate shunt (MLS1 and ICL1) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (ACO1), which is demonstrated by Znf1-binding enrichment at these promoters during the glucose-ethanol shift. Additionally, reduced Pck1 and Fbp1 enzymatic activities correlate well with the data obtained from gene transcription analysis. Cells deleted for ZNF1 also display defective mitochondrial morphology with unclear structures of the inner membrane cristae when grown in ethanol, in agreement with the substantial reduction in the ATP content, suggesting for roles of Znf1 in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. Furthermore, Znf1 also plays a role in tolerance to pH and osmotic stress, especially during the oxidative metabolism. Taken together, our results clearly suggest that Znf1 is a critical transcriptional regulator for stress adaptation during non-fermentative growth with some partial overlapping targets with previously reported regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbours a large group of tightly controlled hexose transporters with different characteristics. Construction and characterization of S. cerevisiae EBY.VW4000, a strain devoid of glucose import, was a milestone in hexose-transporter research. This strain has become a widely used platform for discovery and characterization of transporters from a wide range of organisms. To abolish glucose uptake, 21 genes were knocked out, involving 16 successive deletion rounds with the LoxP/Cre system. Although such intensive modifications are known to increase the risk of genome alterations, the genome of EBY.VW4000 has hitherto not been characterized. Based on a combination of whole genome sequencing, karyotyping and molecular confirmation, the present study reveals that construction of EBY.VW4000 resulted in gene losses and chromosomal rearrangements. Recombinations between the LoxP scars have led to the assembly of four neo-chromosomes, truncation of two chromosomes and loss of two subtelomeric regions. Furthermore, sporulation and spore germination are severely impaired in EBY.VW4000. Karyotyping of the EBY.VW4000 lineage retraced its current chromosomal architecture to four translocations events occurred between the 6th and the 12th rounds of deletion. The presented data facilitate further studies on EBY.VW4000 and highlight the risks of genome alterations associated with repeated use of the LoxP/Cre system.},

abstract = {Genetic information should be accurately transmitted from cell to cell; conversely, the adaptation in evolution and disease is fueled by mutations. In the case of cancer development, multiple genetic changes happen in somatic diploid cells. Most classic studies of the molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis have been performed in haploids. We demonstrate that the parameters of the mutation process are different in diploid cell populations. The genomes of drug-resistant mutants induced in yeast diploids by base analog 6-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) or AID/APOBEC cytosine deaminase PmCDA1 from lamprey carried a stunning load of thousands of unselected mutations. Haploid mutants contained almost an order of magnitude fewer mutations. To explain this, we propose that the distribution of induced mutation rates in the cell population is uneven. The mutants in diploids with coincidental mutations in the two copies of the reporter gene arise from a fraction of cells that are transiently hypersensitive to the mutagenic action of a given mutagen. The progeny of such cells were never recovered in haploids due to the lethality caused by the inactivation of single-copy essential genes in cells with too many induced mutations. In diploid cells, the progeny of hypersensitive cells survived, but their genomes were saturated by heterozygous mutations. The reason for the hypermutability of cells could be transient faults of the mutation prevention pathways, like sanitization of nucleotide pools for HAP or an elevated expression of the PmCDA1 gene or the temporary inability of the destruction of the deaminase. The hypothesis on spikes of mutability may explain the sudden acquisition of multiple mutational changes during evolution and carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Codons that code for the same amino acid are often used with unequal frequencies. This phenomenon is termed codon bias. Here, we report a computational analysis of codon bias in yeast using experimental and theoretical genome-wide data. We show that the most used codons in highly expressed genes can be predicted by mRNA structural data and that the codon choice at each synonymous site within an mRNA is not random with respect to the local secondary structure. Because we also found that the folding stability of intron sequences is strongly correlated with codon bias and mRNA level, our results suggest that codon bias is linked to mRNA folding structure through a mechanism that, at least partially, operates before pre-mRNA splicing. Consistent with this, we report evidence supporting the adaptation of the tRNA pool to the codon profile of the most expressed genes rather than vice versa. We show that the correlation of codon usage with the gene expression level also includes the stop codons that are normally not decoded by aminoacyl-tRNAs. The results reported here are consistent with a role for transcriptional forces in driving codon usage bias via a mechanism that improves gene expression by optimizing mRNA folding structures.},

This process is highly specific, with prion aggregates templating the conversion of identical proteins. However, in some cases non-identical prion proteins can interact to promote or inhibit prion formation or propagation. These interactions affect both the efficiency with which prion diseases are transmitted across species and the normal physiology of yeast prion formation and propagation. Here we examine two types of heterologous prion interactions: interactions between related proteins from different species (the species barrier) and interactions between unrelated prion proteins within a single species. Interestingly, although very subtle changes in protein sequence can significantly reduce or eliminate cross-species prion transmission, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae completely unrelated prion proteins can interact to affect prion formation and propagation.},

abstract = {Cell size increases significantly with increasing ploidy. Differences in cell size and ploidy are associated with alterations in gene expression, although no direct connection has been made between cell size and transcription. Here we show that ploidy-associated changes in gene expression reflect transcriptional adjustment to a larger cell size, implicating cellular geometry as a key parameter in gene regulation. Using RNA-seq, we identified genes whose expression was altered in a tetraploid as compared with the isogenic haploid. A significant fraction of these genes encode cell surface proteins, suggesting an effect of the enlarged cell size on the differential regulation of these genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of these genes in haploid mutants that also produce enlarged size. Surprisingly, many genes differentially regulated in the tetraploid are identically regulated in the enlarged haploids, and the magnitude of change in gene expression correlates with the degree of size enlargement. These results indicate a causal relationship between cell size and transcription, with a size-sensing mechanism that alters transcription in response to size. The genes responding to cell size are enriched for those regulated by two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and components in those pathways were found to mediate size-dependent gene regulation. Transcriptional adjustment to enlarged cell size could underlie other cellular changes associated with polyploidy. The causal relationship between cell size and transcription suggests that cell size homeostasis serves a regulatory role in transcriptome maintenance.},

As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and TopHat) on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression (baySeq, Cuffdiff, DESeq, edgeR and NOISeq) and we explored the consistency between RNA-seq analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement. Overall, our study provides a useful and comprehensive comparison between the two platforms (RNA-seq and microrrays) for gene expression analysis and addresses the contribution of the different steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data.},

In this study, the N($\alpha$)-acetylation status of ribosomal protein was analyzed using NAT mutants combined with two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 60 ribosomal proteins were identified, of which 17 were N($\alpha$)-acetylated by NatA, and two by NatB. The N($\alpha$)-acetylation of two of these, S17 and L23, by NatA was not previously observed. Furthermore, we tested the effect of ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation on protein synthesis using the purified ribosomes from each NAT mutant. It was found that the protein synthesis activities of ribosomes from NatA and NatB mutants were decreased by 27{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively, as compared to that of the normal strain. Furthermore, we have shown that ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation by NatA influences translational fidelity in the presence of paromomycin. These results suggest that ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation is necessary to maintain the ribosome's protein synthesis function.},

abstract = {Prions are proteins that can assume at least two distinct conformational states, one of which is dominant and self-perpetuating. Previously we found that a translation regulator CPEB from Aplysia, ApCPEB, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, ApCPEB can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous ApCPEB to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric ApCPEB blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that ApCPEB can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time.},

abstract = {Prions are transmissible self-replicating alternative states of proteins. Four prions ([PSI+], [URE3], [RNQ+] and [NU+]) can be inherited cytoplasmically in Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains. In the case of [PSI+], there is increasing evidence that prion formation may engender mechanisms to uncover hidden genetic variation. Here, we have analysed the evolution of the prion-determinant (PD) domains across 21 fungi, focusing on compositional biases, repeats and substitution rates. We find evidence for constraint on all four PD domains, but each domain has its own evolutionary dynamics. For [PSI+], the Q/N bias is maintained in fungal clades that diverged one billion years ago, with purifying selection observed within the Saccharomyces species. The degree of Q/N bias is correlated with the degree of local homology to prion-associated repeats, which occur rarely in other proteins (<1{\%} of sequences for the proteomes studied). The evolutionary conservation of Q/N bias in Sup35p is unusual, with only eight other S. cerevisiae proteins showing similar, phylogenetically deep patterns of bias conservation. The [URE3] PD domain is unique to Hemiascomycota; part of the PD domain shows purifying selection, whereas another part engenders bias changes between clades. Also, like for Sup35p, the [RNQ+] and [NU+] PD domains show purifying selection in Saccharomyces species. Additionally, in each proteome, we observe on average several hundred yeast-prion-like domains, with fewest in fission yeast. Our findings on yeast prion evolution provide further support for the functional significance of these molecules.},

Structural homologs to the caspase family (termed metacaspases) engage apoptosis in single-cell eukaryotes, yet the molecular mechanisms that contribute to nondeath roles are currently undefined. Here, we report an unexpected role for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae metacaspase Yca1 in protein quality control. Quantitative proteomic analysis of Deltayca1 cells identified significant alterations to vacuolar catabolism and stress-response proteins in the absence of induced stress. Yca1 protein complexes are enriched for aggregate-remodeling chaperones that colocalize with Yca1-GFP fusions. Finally, deletion and inactivation mutants of Yca1 accrue protein aggregates and autophagic bodies during log-phase growth. Together, our results show that Yca1 contributes to the fitness and adaptability of growing yeast through an aggregate remodeling activity.},

abstract = {Currently, several protein-based genetic determinants, or prions, are described in yeast, and several hundred prion candidates have been predicted. Importantly, many known and potential prion proteins regulate transcription; therefore, prion induction should affect gene expression. While it is generally believed that the prion phenotype should mimic the deletion phenotype, this rule has exceptions. Formed by the transcription factor Sfp1p, [ISP(+) ] is one such exception as the [ISP(+) ] and sfp1$\Delta$ strains differ in many phenotypic traits. These data suggest that effects of prion formation by a transcription factor and its absence may affect gene expression in a different way. However, studies addressing this issue are practically absent. Here, we explore how [ISP(+) ] affects gene expression and how these changes correspond to the effect of SFP1 deletion. Our data indicate that the [ISP(+) ]-related expression changes cannot be explained by the inactivation of Sfp1p. Remarkably, most Sfp1p targets are not affected in the [ISP(+) ] strain; instead, the genes upregulated in the [ISP(+) ] strain are enriched in Gcn4p and Aft1p targets. We propose that Sfp1p serves as a part of a regulatory complex, and the activity of this complex may be modulated differently by the absence or prionization of Sfp1p.},

Yeast cells do not require TFIIS for viability, unless they suffer severe transcriptional stress due to NTP-depleting drugs like 6-azauracil or mycophenolic acid. In order to broaden our knowledge on the role of TFIIS under transcriptional stress, we carried out a genetic screening for suppressors of TFIIS-lacking cells' sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid. Five suppressors were identified, four of which were related to the transcriptional regulation of those genes encoding ribosomal components [rRNAs and ribosomal proteins (RP)], including global regulator SFP1. This led us to discover that RNA polymerase II is hypersensitive to the absence of TFIIS under NTP scarcity conditions when transcribing RP genes. The absence of Sfp1 led to a profound alteration of the transcriptional response to NTP-depletion, thus allowing the expression of RP genes to resist these stressful conditions in the absence of TFIIS. We discuss the effect of transcriptional stress on ribosome biogenesis and propose that TFIIS contributes to prevent a transcriptional imbalance between rDNA and RP genes.},

abstract = {The accumulation of misfolded proteins in intracellular amyloid inclusions, typical of many neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington's and prion disease, is thought to occur after failure of the cellular protein quality control mechanisms. Here we examine the formation of misfolded protein inclusions in the eukaryotic cytosol of yeast and mammalian cell culture models. We identify two intracellular compartments for the sequestration of misfolded cytosolic proteins. Partition of quality control substrates to either compartment seems to depend on their ubiquitination status and aggregation state. Soluble ubiquitinated misfolded proteins accumulate in a juxtanuclear compartment where proteasomes are concentrated. In contrast, terminally aggregated proteins are sequestered in a perivacuolar inclusion. Notably, disease-associated Huntingtin and prion proteins are preferentially directed to the perivacuolar compartment. Enhancing ubiquitination of a prion protein suffices to promote its delivery to the juxtanuclear inclusion. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the preferential accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in inclusions linked to human disease.},

abstract = {[PIN(+)] is the prion form of Rnq1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is necessary for the de novo induction of a second prion, [PSI(+)]. The function of Rnq1, however, is little understood. The limited availability of defective rnq1 alleles impedes the study of its structure-function relationship by genetic analysis. In this study, we isolated rnq1 mutants that are defective in the stable maintenance of the [PIN(+)] prion. Since there is no rnq1 phenotype available that is applicable to a direct selection or screening for loss-of-function rnq1 mutants, we took advantage of a prion inhibitory agent, Rnq1Delta100, to develop a color-based genetic screen. Rnq1Delta100 eliminates the [PSI(+)] prion in the [PIN(+)] state but not in the [pin(-)] state. This allows us to find loss-of-[PIN(+)] rnq1 mutants as white [PSI(+)] colonies. Nine rnq1 mutants with single-amino-acid substitutions were defined. These mutations impaired the stable maintenance of [PIN(+)] and, as a consequence, were also partially defective in the de novo induction of [PSI(+)]. Interestingly, eight of the nine alleles were mapped to the N-terminal region of Rnq1, which is known as the non-prion domain preceding the asparagine and glutamine rich prion domain of Rnq1. Notably, overexpression of these rnq1 mutant proteins restored [PIN(+)] prion activity, suggesting that each of the rnq1 mutants was not completely inactive. These findings indicate that the N-terminal non-prion domain of Rnq1 harbors a potent activity to regulate the maintenance of the [PIN(+)] prion.},

We previously isolated a truncated form of Rnq1, named Rnq1Delta100, as a [PSI(+)]-eliminating factor in S. cerevisiae. Rnq1Delta100 deletes the N-terminal non-prion domain of Rnq1, and eliminates [PSI(+)] in [PIN(+)] yeast. Here we found that [PIN(+)] is transmissible to Rnq1Delta100 in the absence of full-length Rnq1, forming a novel prion variant [RNQ1Delta100(+)]. [RNQ1Delta100(+)] has similar [PIN(+)] properties as it stimulates the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] and is eliminated by the null hsp104Delta mutation, but not by Hsp104 overproduction. In contrast, [RNQ1Delta100(+)] inherits the inhibitory activity and hampers the maintenance of [PSI(+)] though less efficiently than [PIN(+)] made of Rnq1-Rnq1Delta100 co-aggregates. Interestingly, [RNQ1Delta100(+)] prion was eliminated by de novo [PSI(+)] induction. Thus, the [RNQ1Delta100(+)] prion demonstrates selfish activity to eliminate a heterologous prion in S. cerevisiae, showing the first instance of a selfish prion variant in living organisms.},

abstract = {Amyloidogenic proteins associated with a variety of unrelated diseases are typically capable of forming several distinct self-templating conformers. In prion diseases, these different structures, called prion strains (or variants), confer dramatic variation in disease pathology and transmission. Aggregate stability has been found to be a key determinant of the diverse pathological consequences of different prion strains. Yet, it remains largely unclear what other factors might account for the widespread phenotypic variation seen with aggregation-prone proteins. Here, we examined a set of yeast prion variants of the [RNQ+] prion that differ in their ability to induce the formation of another yeast prion called [PSI+]. Remarkably, we found that the [RNQ+] variants require different, non-contiguous regions of the Rnq1 protein for both prion propagation and [PSI+] induction. This included regions outside of the canonical prion-forming domain of Rnq1. Remarkably, such differences did not result in variation in aggregate stability. Our analysis also revealed a striking difference in the ability of these [RNQ+] variants to interact with the chaperone Sis1. Thus, our work shows that the differential influence of various amyloidogenic regions and interactions with host cofactors are critical determinants of the phenotypic consequences of distinct aggregate structures. This helps reveal the complex interdependent factors that influence how a particular amyloid structure may dictate disease pathology and progression.},

abstract = {Epigenetically inherited aggregates of the yeast prion [PSI+] cause genomewide readthrough translation that sometimes increases evolvability in certain harsh environments. The effects of natural selection on modifiers of [PSI+] appearance have been the subject of much debate. It seems likely that [PSI+] would be at least mildly deleterious in most environments, but this may be counteracted by its evolvability properties on rare occasions. Indirect selection on modifiers of [PSI+] is predicted to depend primarily on the spontaneous [PSI+] appearance rate, but this critical parameter has not previously been adequately measured. Here we measure this epimutation rate accurately and precisely as 5.8 x 10(-7) per generation, using a fluctuation test. We also determine that genetic "mimics" of [PSI+] account for up to 80{\%} of all phenotypes involving general nonsense suppression. Using previously developed mathematical models, we can now infer that even in the absence of opportunities for adaptation, modifiers of [PSI+] are only weakly deleterious relative to genetic drift. If we assume that the spontaneous [PSI+] appearance rate is at its evolutionary optimum, then opportunities for adaptation are inferred to be rare, such that the [PSI+] system is favored only very weakly overall. But when we account for the observed increase in the [PSI+] appearance rate in response to stress, we infer much higher overall selection in favor of [PSI+] modifiers, suggesting that [PSI+]-forming ability may be a consequence of selection for evolvability.},

abstract = {Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are ubiquitous antioxidants that protect cells against oxidative stress. We show that the yeast Tsa1/Tsa2 Prxs colocalize to ribosomes and function to protect the Sup35 translation termination factor against oxidative stress-induced formation of its heritable [PSI(+)] prion conformation. In a tsa1 tsa2 [psi(-)] [PIN(+)] strain, the frequency of [PSI(+)] de novo formation is significantly elevated. The Tsa1/Tsa2 Prxs, like other 2-Cys Prxs, have dual activities as peroxidases and chaperones, and we show that the peroxidase activity is required to suppress spontaneous de novo [PSI(+)] prion formation. Molecular oxygen is required for [PSI(+)] prion formation as growth under anaerobic conditions prevents prion formation in the tsa1 tsa2 mutant. Conversely, oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide elevates the rate of de novo [PSI(+)] prion formation leading to increased suppression of all three termination codons in the tsa1 tsa2 mutant. Altered translational fidelity in [PSI(+)] strains may provide a mechanism that promotes genetic variation and phenotypic diversity (True HL, Lindquist SL (2000) Nature 407:477-483). In agreement, we find that prion formation provides yeast cells with an adaptive advantage under oxidative stress conditions, as elimination of the [PSI(+)] prion from tsa1 tsa2 mutants renders the resulting [psi(-)] [pin(-)] cells hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. These data support a model in which Prxs function to protect the ribosomal machinery against oxidative damage, but when these systems become overwhelmed, [PSI(+)] prion formation provides a mechanism for uncovering genetic traits that aid survival during oxidative stress conditions.},

abstract = {[PSI(+)] is a prion of the essential translation termination factor Sup35p. Although mammalian prion infections are uniformly fatal, commonly studied [PSI(+)] variants do not impair growth, leading to suggestions that [PSI(+)] may protect against stress conditions. We report here that over half of [PSI(+)] variants are sick or lethal. These "killer [PSI(+)]s" are compatible with cell growth only when also expressing minimal Sup35C, lacking the N-terminal prion domain. The severe detriment of killer [PSI(+)] results in rapid selection of nonkiller [PSI(+)] variants or loss of the prion. We also report variants of [URE3], a prion of the nitrogen regulation protein Ure2p, that grow much slower than ure2$\Delta$ cells. Our findings give a more realistic picture of the impact of the prion change than does focus on "mild" prion variants.},

abstract = {The continued propagation of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion requires the molecular chaperone Hsp104 yet in cells engineered to overexpress Hsp104; prion propagation is impaired leading to the rapid appearance of prion-free [psi(-)] cells. The underlying mechanism of prion loss in such cells is unknown but is assumed to be due to the complete dissolution of the prion aggregates by the ATP-dependent disaggregase activity of this chaperone. To further explore the mechanism, we have sought to identify cellular factors required for prion loss in such cells. Sti1p and Cpr7p are co-chaperones that modulate the activity of Hsp70/Ssa and Hsp90 chaperones and bind to the C-terminus of Hsp104. Neither Sti1p nor Cpr7p is necessary for prion propagation but we show that deletion of the STI1 and CPR7 genes leads to a significant reduction in the generation of [psi(-)] cells by Hsp104 overexpression. Deletion of the STI1 and CPR7 genes does not modify the elimination of [PSI(+)] by guanidine hydrochloride, which inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp104 but does block elimination of [PSI(+)] by overexpression of either an ATPase-defective mutant of Hsp104 (hsp104(K218T/K620T)) or a 'trap' mutant Hsp104 (hsp104(E285Q/E687Q)) that can bind its substrate but can not release it. These results provide support for the hypothesis that [PSI(+)] elimination by Hsp104 overexpression is not simply a consequence of complete dissolution of the prion aggregates but rather is through a mechanism distinct from the remodelling activity of Hsp104.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are a powerful model for understanding the dynamics of protein aggregation associated with a number of human neurodegenerative disorders. The AAA+ protein disaggregase Hsp104 can sever the amyloid fibrils produced by yeast prions. This action results in the propagation of "seeds" that are transmitted to daughter cells during budding. Overexpression of Hsp104 eliminates the [PSI+] prion but not other prions. Using biochemical methods we identified Hsp104 binding sites in the highly charged middle domain of Sup35, the protein determinant of [PSI+]. Deletion of a short segment of the middle domain (amino acids 129-148) diminishes Hsp104 binding and strongly affects the ability of the middle domain to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp104. In yeast, [PSI+] maintained by Sup35 lacking this segment, like other prions, is propagated by Hsp104 but cannot be cured by Hsp104 overexpression. These results provide new insight into the enigmatic specificity of Hsp104-mediated curing of yeast prions and sheds light on the limitations of the ability of Hsp104 to eliminate aggregates produced by other aggregation-prone proteins.},

abstract = {In vivo propagation of [PSI(+)], an aggregation-prone prion isoform of the yeast release factor Sup35 (eRF3), has previously been shown to require intermediate levels of the chaperone protein Hsp104. Here we perform a detailed study on the mechanism of prion loss after Hsp104 inactivation. Complete or partial inactivation of Hsp104 was achieved by the following approaches: deleting the HSP104 gene; modifying the HSP104 promoter that results in low level of its expression; and overexpressing the dominant-negative ATPase-inactive mutant HSP104 allele. In contrast to guanidine-HCl, an agent blocking prion proliferation, Hsp104 inactivation induced relatively rapid loss of [PSI(+)] and another candidate yeast prion, [PIN(+)]. Thus, the previously hypothesized mechanism of prion dilution in cell divisions due to the blocking of prion proliferation is not sufficient to explain the effect of Hsp104 inactivation. The [PSI(+)] response to increased levels of another chaperone, Hsp70-Ssa, depends on whether the Hsp104 activity is increased or decreased. A decrease of Hsp104 levels or activity is accompanied by a decrease in the number of Sup35(PSI+) aggregates and an increase in their size. This eventually leads to accumulation of huge agglomerates, apparently possessing reduced prion forming capability and representing dead ends of the prion replication cycle. Thus, our data confirm that the primary function of Hsp104 in prion propagation is to disassemble prion aggregates and generate the small prion seeds that initiate new rounds of prion propagation (possibly assisted by Hsp70-Ssa).},

@article{Wang2009e,
abstract = {In mammalian cells, abnormal proteins that escape proteasome-dependent degradation form small aggregates that can be transported into a centrosome-associated structure, called an aggresome. Here we demonstrate that in yeast a single aggregate formed by the huntingtin exon 1 with an expanded polyglutamine domain (103QP) represents a bona fide aggresome that colocalizes with the spindle pole body (the yeast centrosome) in a microtubule-dependent fashion. Since a polypeptide lacking the proline-rich region (P-region) of huntingtin (103Q) cannot form aggresomes, this domain serves as an aggresome-targeting signal. Coexpression of 103Q with 25QP, a soluble polypeptide that also carries the P-region, led to the recruitment of 103Q to the aggresome via formation of hetero-oligomers, indicating the aggresome targeting in trans. To identify additional factors involved in aggresome formation and targeting, we purified 103QP aggresomes and 103Q aggregates and identified the associated proteins using mass spectrometry. Among the aggresome-associated proteins we identified, Cdc48 (VCP/p97) and its cofactors, Ufd1 and Nlp4, were shown genetically to be essential for aggresome formation. The 14-3-3 protein, Bmh1, was also found to be critical for aggresome targeting. Its interaction with the huntingtin fragment and its role in aggresome formation required the huntingtin N-terminal N17 domain, adjacent to the polyQ domain. Accordingly, the huntingtin N17 domain, along with the P-region, plays a role in aggresome targeting. We also present direct genetic evidence for the protective role of aggresomes by demonstrating genetically that aggresome targeting of polyglutamine polypeptides relieves their toxicity.},

By establishing the global genetic interaction network of SIR2 we identified the polarisome, the formin Bni1p, and myosin motor protein Myo2p as essential components of the machinery segregating protein aggregates during mitotic cytokinesis. Moreover, we found that daughter cells can clear themselves of damage by a polarisome- and tropomyosin-dependent polarized flow of aggregates into the mother cell compartment. The role of Sir2p in cytoskeletal functions and polarity is linked to the CCT chaperonin in sir2Delta cells being compromised in folding actin. We discuss the findings in view of recent models hypothesizing that polarity may have evolved to avoid clonal senescence by establishing an aging (soma-like) and rejuvenated (germ-like) lineage.},

@article{Inoue2009,
abstract = {Currently, prion phenomena have been detected in various organisms, in addition to mammals affected by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, various proteins have prion properties and adopt atypical phenotypes as genetic elements, such as the Sup35 and Ure2 proteins, corresponding to the [PSI+] and [URE3] phenotypes, respectively. Each yeast prion protein has a prion-forming region rich in glutamines and/or asparagines, and can form amyloid fibrils in its prion conformation. Studies on yeast prions have revealed that the amyloid fibrils play critical roles in the life cycle of the yeast prion. First, the amyloid fibril binds the normal prion protein and catalyzes a structural conversion into the abnormal form, the key event of the prion phenomenon. Second, the amyloid fibril is related to the strain differences of the prion phenotypes, by its substructural differences. Third, the number of prion elements multiplies by the fragmentation of amyloid fibrils, which is mediated by a chaperone system in which Hsp104 plays a central role, and the prion elements are distributed to the daughter cells during cell division. Moreover, heterologous prion-prion communications may occur, probably by cross-seeding of amyloid fibrils among different prion proteins in the same yeast cell. Findings achieved by yeast prion studies are making great contributions toward understanding the characteristics of amyloid fibrils and prions.},

abstract = {Acute stress causes a rapid redistribution of protein quality control components and aggregation-prone proteins to diverse subcellular compartments. How these remarkable changes come about is not well understood. Using a phenotypic reporter for a synthetic yeast prion, we identified two protein-sorting factors of the Hook family, termed Btn2 and Cur1, as key regulators of spatial protein quality control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Btn2 and Cur1 are undetectable under normal growth conditions but accumulate in stressed cells due to increased gene expression and reduced proteasomal turnover. Newly synthesized Btn2 can associate with the small heat shock protein Hsp42 to promote the sorting of misfolded proteins to a peripheral protein deposition site. Alternatively, Btn2 can bind to the chaperone Sis1 to facilitate the targeting of misfolded proteins to a juxtanuclear compartment. Protein redistribution by Btn2 is accompanied by a gradual depletion of Sis1 from the cytosol, which is mediated by the sorting factor Cur1. On the basis of these findings, we propose a dynamic model that explains the subcellular distribution of misfolded proteins as a function of the cytosolic concentrations of molecular chaperones and protein-sorting factors. Our model suggests that protein aggregation is not a haphazard process but rather an orchestrated cellular response that adjusts the flux of misfolded proteins to the capacities of the protein quality control system.},

[PIN(+)] is the misfolded infectious prion form of the Rnq1 protein that displays distinct fluorescent foci in the presence of RNQ1-GFP and exists in different physical conformations, called variants. Here, we show that over 97{\%} of the library deletion strains are [PIN(+)]. Of the 141 remaining strains that have completely (58) or partially (83) lost [PIN(+)], 139 deletions were able to efficiently maintain three different [PIN(+)] variants despite extensive growth and storage at 4 degrees C. One strain, cue2Delta, displayed an alteration in the RNQ1-GFP fluorescent shape, but the Rnq1p prion aggregate shows no biochemical differences from the wild-type. Only strains containing a deletion of either HSP104 or RNQ1 are unable to maintain [PIN(+)], indicating that 5153 non-essential genes are not required for [PIN(+)] propagation.},

abstract = {Cross-beta fibrous protein aggregates (amyloids and amyloid-based prions) are found in mammals (including humans) and fungi (including yeast), and are associated with both diseases and heritable traits. The Hsp104/70/40 chaperone machinery controls propagation of yeast prions. The Hsp70 chaperones Ssa and Ssb show opposite effects on [PSI(+) ], a prion form of the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3). Ssb is bound to translating ribosomes via ribosome-associated complex (RAC), composed of Hsp40-Zuo1 and Hsp70-Ssz1. Here we demonstrate that RAC disruption increases de novo prion formation in a manner similar to Ssb depletion, but interferes with prion propagation in a manner similar to Ssb overproduction. Release of Ssb into the cytosol in RAC-deficient cells antagonizes binding of Ssa to amyloids. Thus, propagation of an amyloid formed due to lack of ribosome-associated Ssb can be counteracted by cytosolic Ssb, generating a feedback regulatory circuit. Release of Ssb from ribosomes is also observed in wild type cells during growth in poor synthetic medium. Ssb is, in a significant part, responsible for the prion destabilization in these conditions, underlining the physiological relevance of the Ssb-based regulatory circuit.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes encode multiple 70-kDa heat-shock proteins (HSP70s). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSP70 family is comprised of eight members. Here we present the nucleotide sequence of the SSA3 and SSB2 genes, completing the nucleotide sequence data for the yeast HSP70 family. We have analyzed these yeast sequences as well as 29 HSP70s from 24 additional eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. Comparison of the sequences demonstrates the extreme conservation of HSP70s; proteins from the most distantly related species share at least 45{\%} identity and more than one-sixth of the amino acids are identical in the aligned region (567 amino acids) among all proteins analyzed. Phylogenetic trees constructed by two independent methods indicate that ancient molecular and cellular events have given rise to at least four monophyletic groups of eukaryotic HSP70 proteins. Each group of evolutionarily similar HSP70s shares a common intracellular localization and is presumed to be comprised of functional homologues; these include heat-shock proteins of the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. HSP70s localized in mitochondria and plastids are most similar to the DnaK HSP70 homologues in purple bacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively, which is consistent with the proposed prokaryotic origin of these organelles. The analyses indicate that the major eukaryotic HSP70 groups arose prior to the divergence of the earliest eukaryotes, roughly 2 billion years ago. In some cases, as exemplified by the SSA genes encoding the cytoplasmic HSP70s of S. cerevisiae, more recent duplication events have given rise to subfamilies within the major groups. The S. cerevisiae SSB proteins comprise a unique subfamily not identified in other species to date. This subfamily appears to have resulted from an ancient gene duplication that occurred at approximately the same time as the origin of the major eukaryotic HSP70 groups.},

abstract = {Plants are sessile organisms, and their ability to adapt to stress is crucial for survival in natural environments. Many observations suggest a relationship between stress tolerance and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in plants, but the roles of individual HSPs are poorly characterized. We report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing less than usual amounts of HSP101, a result of either antisense inhibition or cosuppression, grew at normal rates but had a severely diminished capacity to acquire heat tolerance after mild conditioning pretreatments. The naturally high tolerance of germinating seeds, which express HSP101 as a result of developmental regulation, was also profoundly decreased. Conversely, plants constitutively expressing HSP101 tolerated sudden shifts to extreme temperatures better than did vector controls. We conclude that HSP101 plays a pivotal role in heat tolerance in Arabidopsis. Given the high evolutionary conservation of this protein and the fact that altering HSP101 expression had no detrimental effects on normal growth or development, one should be able to manipulate the stress tolerance of other plants by altering the expression of this protein.},

abstract = {The frequency with which the yeast [PSI(+)] prion form of Sup35 arises de novo is controlled by a number of genetic and environmental factors. We have previously shown that in cells lacking the antioxidant peroxiredoxin proteins Tsa1 and Tsa2, the frequency of de novo formation of [PSI(+)] is greatly elevated. We show here that Tsa1/Tsa2 also function to suppress the formation of the [PIN(+)] prion form of Rnq1. However, although oxidative stress increases the de novo formation of both [PIN(+)] and [PSI(+)], it does not overcome the requirement of cells being [PIN(+)] to form the [PSI(+)] prion. We use an anti-methionine sulfoxide antibody to show that methionine oxidation is elevated in Sup35 during oxidative stress conditions. Abrogating Sup35 methionine oxidation by overexpressing methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSRA) prevents [PSI(+)] formation, indicating that Sup35 oxidation may underlie the switch from a soluble to an aggregated form of Sup35. In contrast, we were unable to detect methionine oxidation of Rnq1, and MSRA overexpression did not affect [PIN(+)] formation in a tsa1 tsa2 mutant. The molecular basis of how yeast and mammalian prions form infectious amyloid-like structures de novo is poorly understood. Our data suggest a causal link between Sup35 protein oxidation and de novo [PSI(+)] prion formation.},

abstract = {Yeast prions, such as [PSI(+)], [RNQ(+)], and [URE3], are heritable elements formed by proteins capable of acquiring self-perpetuating conformations. Their propagation is dependent on fragmentation of the amyloid protein complexes formed to generate the additional seeds necessary for conversion of nascent soluble protein to the prion conformation. We report that, in addition to its known role in [RNQ(+)] propagation, Sis1, a J-protein cochaperone of Hsp70 Ssa, is also specifically required for propagation of [PSI(+)] and [URE3]. Whereas both [RNQ(+)] and [URE3] are cured rapidly upon SIS1 repression, [PSI(+)] loss is markedly slower. This disparity cannot be explained simply by differences in seed number, as [RNQ(+)] and [PSI(+)] are lost with similar kinetics upon inhibition of Hsp104, a remodeling protein required for propagation of all yeast prions. Rather, in the case of [PSI(+)], our results are consistent with the partial impairment, rather than the complete abolition, of fragmentation of prion complexes upon Sis1 depletion. We suggest that a common set of molecular chaperones, the J-protein Sis1, the Hsp70 Ssa, and the AAA+ ATPase Hsp104, act sequentially in the fragmentation of all yeast prions, but that the threshold of Sis1 activity required for each prion varies.},

In this report we describe growth conditions for efficient mutation or elimination of the Psi(+) determinant. Incubation of Psi(+) cultures in hypertonic nutrient medium resulted in rapid conversion to a culture containing predominantly Psi(-) cells during the growth cycle. The kinetics of Psi(+) to Psi(-) conversion established that the occurrence of Psi(-) cells was due to induction and not to selection of pre-existing Psi(-) cells.

abstract = {Prions are self-templating protein aggregates that were originally identified as the causative agent of prion diseases in mammals, but have since been discovered in other kingdoms. Mammalian prions represent a unique class of infectious agents that are composed of misfolded prion protein. Prion proteins usually exist as soluble proteins but can refold and assemble into highly ordered, self-propagating prion polymers. The prion concept is also applicable to a growing number of non-Mendelian elements of inheritance in lower eukaryotes. While prions identified in mammals are clearly pathogens, prions in lower eukaryotes can be either detrimental or beneficial to the host. Prion phenotypes in fungi are transmitted vertically from mother to daughter cells during cell division and horizontally during mating or abortive mating, but extracellular phases have not been reported. Recent findings now demonstrate that in a mammalian cell environment, protein aggregates derived from yeast prion domains exhibit a prion life cycle similar to mammalian prions propagated ex vivo. This life cycle includes a soluble state of the protein, an induction phase by exogenous prion fibrils, stable replication of prion entities, vertical transmission to progeny and natural horizontal transmission to neighboring cells. Our data reveal that mammalian cells contain all co-factors required for cytosolic prion propagation and dissemination. This has important implications for understanding prion-like properties of disease-related protein aggregates. In light of the growing number of identified functional amyloids, cell-to-cell propagation of cytosolic protein conformers might not only be relevant for the spreading of disease-associated proteins, but might also be of more general relevance under non-disease conditions.},

The J-domain, the signature motif of the Hsp40 family, orchestrates interaction with the DnaK ATPase domain. We studied the J-domain by creating 42 mutant E. coli DnaJ variants and examining their phenotypes in various separate in vivo assays, namely, bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, motility, and propagation of bacteriophage lambda. Most mutants studied behaved like wild type in all assays. In addition to the (33)HisProAsp(35) (HPD) tripeptide found in all known functional J-domains, our study uncovered three new single substitution mutations (Y25A, K26A, and F47A) that totally abolish J-domain function. Furthermore, two glycine substitution mutants in an exposed flexible loop (R36G, N37G) showed partial loss of J-domain function alone and complete loss of function as a triple (RNQ-GGG) mutant coupled with the phenotypically silent Q38G. Interestingly, all the essential residues map to a small region on the same solvent-exposed face of the J-domain. Engineered mutations in the corresponding residues of the human Hdj1 J-domain grafted in E. coli DnaJ also resulted in loss of function, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved interaction surface. We propose that these clustered residues impart critical sequence determinants necessary for J-domain catalytic activity and reversible contact interface with the DnaK ATPase domain.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are heritable amyloid aggregates of functional yeast proteins; their propagation to subsequent cell generations is dependent upon fragmentation of prion protein aggregates by molecular chaperone proteins. Mounting evidence indicates the J-protein Sis1 may act as an amyloid specificity factor, recognizing prion and other amyloid aggregates and enabling Ssa and Hsp104 to act in prion fragmentation. Chaperone interactions with prions, however, can be affected by variations in amyloid-core structure resulting in distinct prion variants or 'strains'. Our genetic analysis revealed that Sis1 domain requirements by distinct variants of [PSI+] are strongly dependent upon overall variant stability. Notably, multiple strong [PSI+] variants can be maintained by a minimal construct of Sis1 consisting of only the J-domain and glycine/phenylalanine-rich (G/F) region that was previously shown to be sufficient for cell viability and [RNQ+] prion propagation. In contrast, weak [PSI+] variants are lost under the same conditions but maintained by the expression of an Sis1 construct that lacks only the G/F region and cannot support [RNQ+] propagation, revealing mutually exclusive requirements for Sis1 function between these two prions. Prion loss is not due to [PSI+]-dependent toxicity or dependent upon a particular yeast genetic background. These observations necessitate that Sis1 must have at least two distinct functional roles that individual prions differentially require for propagation and which are localized to the glycine-rich domains of the Sis1. Based on these distinctions, Sis1 plasmid-shuffling in a [PSI+]/[RNQ+] strain permitted J-protein-dependent prion selection for either prion. We also found that, despite an initial report to the contrary, the human homolog of Sis1, Hdj1, is capable of [PSI+] prion propagation in place of Sis1. This conservation of function is also prion-variant dependent, indicating that only one of the two Sis1-prion functions may have been maintained in eukaryotic chaperone evolution.},

abstract = {A simple quantitative in vivo assay has been developed for measuring the efficiency of translation of one or other of the three termination codons. UAA, UAG and UGA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay employs a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase-beta-galactosidase gene fusion, carried on a multicopy plasmid, in which the otherwise retained reading frame is disrupted by one or other of the three termination codons. Termination readthrough is thus quantitated by measuring beta-galactosidase in transformed strains. Using these plasmids to quantitate the endogenous levels of termination readthrough we show that readthrough of all three codons can be detected in a non-suppressor (sup+) strain of S. cerevisiae. The efficiency of this endogenous readthrough is much higher in a [psi+] strain than in a [psi-] strain with the UGA codon being the leakiest in the nucleotide context used. The utility of the assay plasmids for studying genetic modifiers of nonsense suppressors is also shown by their use to demonstrate that the cytoplasmic genetic determinant [psi+] broadens the decoding properties of a serine-inserting UAA suppressor tRNA (SUQ5) to allow it to translate the other two termination codons in the order of efficiency UAA greater than UAG greater than UGA.},

An intact peptide-binding domain is essential and an alteration of a conserved residue in the peptide-binding cleft (V442) affects function. However, Ssb tolerates a number of alterations in the peptide-binding cleft, revealing a high degree of flexibility in its functional requirements. Because binding of Ssb to peptide substrates in vitro was undetectable, we assessed the importance of substrate binding using the chimera BAB, in which the peptide binding domain of Ssb is exchanged for the analogous domain of the more "classical" Hsp70, Ssa. BAB, which binds peptide substrates in vitro, can substitute for Ssb in vivo. Alteration of a residue in the peptide-binding cleft of BAB creates a protein with a reduced affinity for peptide and altered ribosome binding that is unable to substitute for Ssb in vivo. These results indicate that Ssb's ability to bind unfolded polypeptides is likely critical for its function. This binding accounts, in part, for its stable interaction with translating ribosomes, even although it has a low affinity for peptides that detectably bind to other Hsp70s in vitro. These unusual properties may allow Ssb to function efficiently as a chaperone for ribosome-bound nascent chains.},

abstract = {Why eukaryotes encode multiple Hsp70 isoforms is unclear. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssa1p and Ssa2p are constitutive 98{\%} identical Hsp70's. Stress-inducible Ssa3p and Ssa4p are 80{\%} identical to Ssa1/2p. We show Ssa1p-4p have distinct functions affecting [PSI(+)] and [URE3] prions. When expressed as the only Ssa, Ssa1p antagonized [URE3] and Ssa2p antagonized [PSI(+)]. Ssa3p and Ssa4p influenced [URE3] and [PSI(+)] somewhat differently but overall their effects paralleled those of Ssa1p and Ssa2p, respectively. Additionally, Ssa3p suppressed a prion-inhibitory effect of elevated temperature. Our previously described Ssa1-21p mutant weakens [PSI(+)] in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and abolishes it in SSA1-21 ssa2Delta cells. To test if the same mutation affected other prions or altered Ssa2p similarly, we compared effects of a constructed Ssa2-21p mutant and Ssa1-21p on both prions. Surprisingly, [URE3] was unaffected in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and could propagate in SSA1-21 ssa2Delta cells. Ssa2-21p impaired [URE3] considerably and weakened [PSI(+)] strongly but in a manner distinct from Ssa1-21p, highlighting functional differences between these nearly identical Hsp70's. Our data uncover exquisite functional differences among isoforms of a highly homologous cytosolic Hsp70 subfamily and point to a possibility that variations in Hsp70 function that might improve fitness under optimal conditions are also important during stress.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a large family of genes related to hsp70, the major heat shock-inducible gene of Drosophila melanogaster. One subfamily, identified by sequence homology, contains four genes, SSA1, SSA2, SSA3, and SSA4 (formerly YG100, YG102, YG106, and YG107, respectively). Previous studies showed that strains containing mutations in SSA1 and SSA2 are temperature sensitive for growth. SSA4, which is normally heat inducible and not expressed during vegetative growth, is expressed at high levels in ssa1 ssa2 strains at 23 degrees C. We constructed mutations in SSA3 and SSA4 and analyzed strains carrying mutations in the four genes. Strains carrying mutations in SSA3 SSA4 or SSA3 and SSA4 were indistinguishable from the wild type. However, ssa1 ssa2 ssa4 strains were inviable. SSA3, like SSA4, is a heat-inducible gene that is not normally expressed at 23 degrees C. Nevertheless, an intact copy of SSA3 regulated by the constitutive SSA2 promoter was capable of rescuing a ssa1 ssa2 ssa4 strain. This indicates that SSA3 encodes a functional protein and that the SSA1, SSA2, SSA3, and SSA4 gene products are functionally similar.},

Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicated that the corresponding gene is a member of a multigene family. The mRNA for HSP101 was not detected in 2-day-old etiolated soybean seedlings grown at 28 degrees C but was induced by elevated temperatures. DNA sequence comparison has shown that the corresponding gene belongs to the Clp (caseinolytic protease) (or Hsp100) gene family, which is evolutionarily conserved and found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. On the basis of the spacer length between the two conserved ATP binding regions, this gene has been identified as a member of the ClpB subfamily. Unlike other Clp genes previously isolated from higher plants, the expression of this soybean Hsp101 gene is heat inducible, and it does not have an N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to chloroplasts. Transformation of the soybean Hsp101 gene into a yeast HSP104 deletion mutant complemented restoration of acquired thermotolerance, a process in which cells survive an otherwise lethal heat stress after they are given a permissive heat treatment.},

abstract = {Yeast Hsp104 and its bacterial homolog, ClpB, are Clp/Hsp100 molecular chaperones and AAA+ ATPases. Hsp104 and ClpB collaborate with the Hsp70 and DnaK chaperone systems, respectively, to retrieve and reactivate stress-denatured proteins from aggregates. The action of Hsp104 and ClpB in promoting cell survival following heat stress is species-specific: Hsp104 cannot function in bacteria and ClpB cannot act in yeast. To determine the regions of Hsp104 and ClpB necessary for this specificity, we tested chimeras of Hsp104 and ClpB in vivo and in vitro. We show that the Hsp104 and ClpB middle domains dictate the species-specificity of Hsp104 and ClpB for cell survival at high temperature. In protein reactivation assays in vitro, chimeras containing the Hsp104 middle domain collaborate with Hsp70 and those with the ClpB middle domain function with DnaK. The region responsible for the specificity is within helix 2 and helix 3 of the middle domain. Additionally, several mutants containing amino acid substitutions in helix 2 of the ClpB middle domain are defective in protein disaggregation in collaboration with DnaK. In a bacterial two-hybrid assay, DnaK interacts with ClpB and with chimeras that have the ClpB middle domain, implying that species-specificity is due to an interaction between DnaK and the middle domain of ClpB. Our results suggest that the interaction between Hsp70/DnaK and helix 2 of the middle domain of Hsp104/ClpB determines the specificity required for protein disaggregation both in vivo and in vitro, as well as for cellular thermotolerance.},

We constructed yeast-bacterial chimeric chaperones to resolve the roles of Hsp104 domains, and by extension chaperones that interact with these domains, in prion propagation. Our results show that, as with amorphous aggregate dissolution, the Hsp70/40 system recruits prion substrates to Hsp104 via its top ring. By adapting our chimera to couple to an inactive protease "trap," we monitored the reaction products of prion propagation in vivo. We find that prion maintenance is accompanied by translocation of prion proteins through Hsp104 hexamers and that both processes critically rely upon the Hsp40 Sis1. Our data suggest that yeast prion replication is a natural extension of chaperone activity in dissolving amorphous aggregates, distinguished from its ancestral reaction by the ordered, self-propagating structure of the substrate.},

It has recently been shown that ClpP is a heat shock protein. Here we show that ClpB is the Escherichia coli heat shock protein F84.1. The F84.1 protein was overproduced in strains containing the clpB gene on a plasmid and was absent from two-dimensional gels from a clpB null mutation. Besides possessing a slower growth rate at 44 degrees C, the null mutant strain had a higher rate of death at 50 degrees C. We used reverse transcription of in vivo mRNA to show that the clpB gene was expressed from a sigma 32-specific promoter consensus sequence at both 37 and 42 degrees C. We noted that the clpB+ gene also caused the appearance of a second protein spot, F68.5, on two-dimensional gels. This spot was approximately 147 amino acids smaller than F84.1 and most probably is the result of a second translational start on the clpB mRNA. F68.5 can be observed on many published two-dimensional gels of heat-induced E. coli proteins, but the original catalog of 17 heat shock proteins did not include this spot.

It was also reported that guanidine inhibits Hsp104 ATPase and disaggregation activity. We show that in vitro guanidine significantly inhibits the disaggregation activity of ClpB, the bacterial orthologue of Hsp104. However, guanidine exerts opposite effects on the ATPase activities of Hsp104 and ClpB. While the ATPase activity of Hsp104 is inhibited, the analogous ClpB activity is stimulated several-fold. Mutation of the universally conserved aspartic acid residue in position 184 to serine (D184S) in HSP104 and the analogous mutation in clpB (D178S) resulted in chaperones with lower disaggregating and ATPase activities. The activities of such changed chaperones are not influenced by guanidine, which suggests the role of this residue in the interaction with guanidine.},

abstract = {In all organisms, mild heat pretreatments induce tolerance to high temperatures. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such pretreatments strongly induce heat-shock protein (Hsp) 104, and hsp104 mutations greatly reduce high-temperature survival, indicating Hsp1O4 plays a critical role in induced thermotolerance. Surprisingly, however, a heat-shock transcription factor mutation (hsf1-m3) that blocks the induction of Hsps does not block induced thermotolerance. To resolve these apparent contradictions, we reexamined Hsp expression in hsf1-m3 cells. HsplO4 was expressed at a higher basal level in this strain than in other S. cerevisiae strains. Moreover, whereas the hsf1-m3 mutation completely blocked the induction of Hsp26 by heat, it did not block the induction of Hsp1O4. HSP104 could not be deleted in hsf1-m3 cells because the expression of heat-shock factor (and the viability of the strain) requires nonsense suppression mediated by the yeast prion [PSI+], which in turn depends upon Hsp1O4. To determine whether the level of Hsp1O4 expressed in hsf1-m3 cells is sufficient for thermotolerance, we used heterologous promoters to regulate Hsp1O4 expression in other strains. In the presence of other inducible factors (with a conditioning pretreatment), low levels of Hsp1O4 are sufficient to provide full thermotolerance. More remarkably, in the absence of other inducible factors (without a pretreatment), high levels of Hsp1O4 are sufficient. We conclude that Hsp1O4 plays a central role in ameliorating heat toxicity. Because Hsp1O4 is nontoxic and highly conserved, manipulating the expression of Hsp1OO proteins provides an excellent prospect for manipulating thermotolerance in other species.},

Fitting atomic models of Hsp104 domains to the EM density maps plus supporting biochemical measurements show how the domain movements displace sites bearing the substrate-binding tyrosine loops. This provides the structural basis for N- to C-terminal substrate threading through the central cavity, enabling a clockwise handover of substrate in the NBD1 ring and coordinated substrate binding between NBD1 and NBD2. Asymmetric reconstructions of Hsp104 in the presence of ATPgammaS or ATP support sequential rather than concerted ATP hydrolysis in the NBD1 ring.},

abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) gate the only conduits for nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotes. Their gate is formed by nucleoporins containing large intrinsically disordered domains with multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). In combination, these are hypothesized to form a structurally and chemically homogeneous network of random coils at the NPC center, which sorts macromolecules by size and hydrophobicity. Instead, we found that FG domains are structurally and chemically heterogeneous. They adopt distinct categories of intrinsically disordered structures in non-random distributions. Some adopt globular, collapsed coil configurations and are characterized by a low charge content. Others are highly charged and adopt more dynamic, extended coil conformations. Interestingly, several FG nucleoporins feature both types of structures in a bimodal distribution along their polypeptide chain. This distribution functionally correlates with the attractive or repulsive character of their interactions with collapsed coil FG domains displaying cohesion toward one another and extended coil FG domains displaying repulsion. Topologically, these bipartite FG domains may resemble sticky molten globules connected to the tip of relaxed or extended coils. Within the NPC, the crowding of FG nucleoporins and the segregation of their disordered structures based on their topology, dimensions, and cohesive character could force the FG domains to form a tubular gate structure or transporter at the NPC center featuring two separate zones of traffic with distinct physicochemical properties.},

abstract = {Prions are infectious proteins that cause fatal diseases in mammals. Prions have also been found in fungi, but studies on their role in nature are scarce. The proposed biological function of fungal prions is debated and varies from detrimental to benign or even beneficial. [Het-s] is a prion of the fungus Podospora anserina. The het-s locus exists as two antagonistic alleles that constitute an allorecognition system: the het-s allele encoding the protein variant capable of prion formation and the het-S allele encoding a protein variant that cannot form a prion. We document here that het-s alleles, capable of prion formation, are nearly twice as frequent as het-S alleles in a natural population of 112 individuals. Then, we report a 92{\%} prevalence of [Het-s] prion infection among the het-s isolates and find evidence of the role of the [Het-s]/het-S allorecognition system on the incidence of infection by a deleterious senescence plasmid. We explain the het-s/het-S allele ratios by the existence of two selective forces operating at different levels. We propose that during the somatic stage, the role of [Het-s]/HET-S in allorecognition leads to frequency-dependent selection for which an equilibrated frequency would be optimal. However, in the sexual cycle, the [Het-s] prion causes meiotic drive favoring the het-s allele. Our findings indicate that [Het-s] is a selected and, therefore, widespread prion whose activity as selfish genetic element is counteracted by balancing selection for allorecognition polymorphism.},

abstract = {When the translation termination factor Sup35 adopts the prion state, [PSI(+)], the read-through of stop codons increases, uncovering hidden genetic variation and giving rise to new, often beneficial, phenotypes. Evidence suggests that prion induction involves a process of maturation, but this has never been studied in detail. To do so, we used a visually tractable prion model consisting of the Sup35 prion domain fused to GFP (PrD-GFP) and overexpressed it to achieve induction in many cells simultaneously. PrD-GFP first assembled into Rings as previously described. Rings propagated for many generations before the protein transitioned into a Dot structure. Dots transmitted the [PSI(+)] phenotype through mating and meiosis, but Rings did not. Surprisingly, the underlying amyloid conformation of PrD-GFP was identical in Rings and Dots. However, by electron microscopy, Rings consisted of very long uninterrupted bundles of fibers, whereas Dot fibers were highly fragmented. Both forms were deposited at the IPOD, a biologically ancient compartment for the deposition of irreversibly aggregated proteins that we propose is the site of de novo prion induction. We find that oxidatively damaged proteins are also localized there, helping to explain how proteotoxic stresses increase the rate of prion induction. Curing PrD-GFP prions, by inhibiting Hsp104's fragmentation activity, reversed the induction process: Dot cells produced Rings before PrD-GFP reverted to the soluble state. Thus, formation of the genetically transmissible prion state is a two-step process that involves an ancient system for the asymmetric inheritance of damaged proteins and heritable changes in the extent of prion fragmentation.},

abstract = {At the Cold Spring Harbor Meeting on 'Molecular Chaperones and the Heat Shock Response' in May 1996, Susan Lindquist presented evidence that a chaperone of yeast termed Hsp104, which her group had been investigating for several years, is able to dissolve protein aggregates (Glover, J.R., Lindquist, S., 1998. Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40: a novel chaperone system that rescues previously aggregated proteins. Cell 94, 73-82). Among many of the participants this news stimulated reactions reaching from decided skepticism to utter disbelief because protein aggregation was widely considered to be an irreversible process. Several years and publications later, it is undeniable that Susan had been right. Hsp104 is an ATP dependent molecular machine that-in cooperation with Hsp70 and Hsp40-extracts polypeptide chains from protein aggregates and facilitates their refolding, although the molecular details of this process are still poorly understood. Meanwhile, close homologues of Hsp104 have been identified in bacteria (ClpB), in mitochondria (Hsp78), and in the cytosol of plants (Hsp101), but intriguingly not in the cytosol of animal cells (Mosser, D.D., Ho, S., Glover, J.R., 2004. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104 enhances the chaperone capacity of human cells and inhibits heat stress-induced proapoptotic signaling. Biochemistry 43, 8107-8115). Observations that Hsp104 plays an essential role in the maintenance of yeast prions (see review by James Shorter in this issue) have attracted even more attention to the molecular mechanism of this ATP dependent chaperone (Chernoff, Y.O., Lindquist, S.L., Ono, B., Inge-Vechtomov, S.G., Liebman, S.W., 1995. Role of the chaperone protein Hsp104 in propagation of the yeast prion-like factor [PSI+]. Science 268, 880-884).},

abstract = {Many of the fatal neurodegenerative disorders that plague humankind, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are connected with the misfolding of specific proteins into a surprisingly generic fibrous conformation termed amyloid. Prior to amyloid fiber assembly, many proteins populate a common oligomeric conformation, which may be severely cytotoxic. Therapeutic innovations are desperately sought to safely reverse this aberrant protein aggregation and return proteins to normal function. Whether mammalian cells possess any such endogenous activity remains unclear. By contrast, fungi, plants and bacteria all express Hsp104, a protein-remodeling factor, which synergizes with the Hsp70 chaperone system to resolve aggregated proteins and restore their functionality. Surprisingly, amyloids can also be adaptive. In yeast, Hsp104 directly regulates the amyloidogenesis of several prion proteins, which can confer selective advantages. Here, I review the modus operandi of Hsp104 and showcase efforts to unleash Hsp104 on the protein-misfolding events connected to disparate neurodegenerative amyloidoses.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are elongated protein aggregates well known for their association with many human diseases. However, similar structures have also been found in other organisms and amyloid fibrils can also be formed in vitro by other proteins usually under non-physiological conditions. In all cases, these fibrils assemble in a nucleated polymerization reaction with a pronounced lag phase that can be eliminated by supplying pre-formed fibrils as seeds. Once formed, the fibrils are usually very stable, except for their tendency to break into smaller pieces forming more growing ends in the process. These properties give amyloid fibers a self-replicating character dependent only on a source of soluble protein. For some systems and under certain circumstances this can lead to infectious protein structures, so-called prions, that can be passed from one organism to another as in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and in fungal prion systems. Structural details about these processes have emerged only recently, mostly on account of the inability of traditional high-resolution methods to deal with insoluble, filamentous specimens. In consequence, current models for amyloid fibrils are based on fewer constraints than common atomic-resolution structures. This review gives an overview of the constraints used for the development of amyloid models and the methods used to derive them. The principally possible structures will be introduced by discussing current models of amyloid fibrils from Alzheimer's beta-peptide, amylin and several fungal systems. The infectivity of some amyloids under specific conditions might not be due to a principal structural difference between infectious and non-infectious amyloids, but could result from an interplay of the rates for filament nucleation, growth, fragmentation, and clearance.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that Sup35p prion fibrils probably have a parallel in-register $\beta$-structure. However, the part(s) of the N-domain critical for fibril formation and maintenance of the [PSI(+)] phenotype remains unclear. Here we designed a set of five SUP35 mutant alleles (sup35(KK)) with lysine substitutions in each of five N-domain repeats, and investigated their effect on infectivity and ability of corresponding proteins to aggregate and coaggregate with wild type Sup35p in the [PSI(+)] strain. Alleles sup35-M1 (Y46K/Q47K) and sup35-M2 (Q61K/Q62K) led to prion loss, whereas sup35-M3 (Q70K/Q71K), sup35-M4 (Q80K/Q81K), and sup35-M5 (Q89K/Q90K) were able to maintain the [PSI(+)] prion. This suggests that the critical part of the parallel in-register $\beta$-structure for the studied [PSI(+)] prion variant lies in the first 63-69 residues. Our study also reveals an unexpected interplay between the wild type Sup35p and proteins expressed from the sup35(KK) alleles during prionization. Both Sup35-M1p and Sup35-M2p coaggregated with Sup35p, but only sup35-M2 led to prion loss in a dominant manner. We suggest that in the fibrils, Sup35p can bind to Sup35-M1p in the same conformation, whereas Sup35-M2p only allowed the Sup35p conformation that leads to the non-heritable fold. Mutations sup35-M4 and sup35-M5 influence the structure of the prion forming region to a lesser extent, and can lead to the formation of new prion variants.},

abstract = {MCM1 performs several functions necessary for its role in regulating cell type-specific gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: DNA binding, transcription activation, and interaction with coregulatory proteins such as alpha 1. We analyzed a set of MCM1 deletion derivatives using in vivo reporter gene assays and in vitro DNA-binding studies to determine which regions of MCM1 are important for its various activities. We also analyzed a set of LexA-MCM1 hybrids to examine the ability of different segments of MCM1 to activate transcription independent of MCM1's DNA-binding function. The first third of MCM1 [MCM1(1-96)], which includes an 80-residue segment homologous to the mammalian serum response factor, was sufficient for high-affinity DNA binding, for activation of reporter gene expression, and for interaction with alpha 1 in vitro and in vivo. However, the ability of MCM1(1-96) to activate transcription and to interact with alpha 1 was somewhat reduced compared with wild-type MCM1 [MCM1(1-286)]. Optimal interaction with alpha 1 required residues 99 to 117, in which 18 of 19 amino acids are acidic in character. Optimal transcription activation required a segment from residues 188 to 286, in which 50{\%} of the amino acids are glutamine. Deletion of this segment from MCM1 reduced expression of reporter genes by about twofold. Moreover, LexA-MCM1 hybrids containing this segment were able to activate expression of reporter genes that rely on LexA binding sites as potential upstream activation sequences. Thus, glutamine-rich regions may contribute to the activation function of yeast transcription activators, as has been suggested for glutamine-rich mammalian proteins such as Sp1.},

It activates alpha-specific genes together with MAT alpha 1, and represses a-specific genes together with MAT alpha 2. Alone, MCM1 can activate transcription. To determine whether different domains of the protein mediate these diverse functions, we constructed and analyzed several mcm1 mutants. The gene expression and minichromosome maintenance phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the role of MCM1 in DNA replication initiation may not involve transcriptional activation. However, both transcription and replication activities require only the 80-amino-acid fragment of MCM1 homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the serum response factor (SRF). This small fragment is also sufficient for cell viability and repression of a-specific genes. A polyacidic amino acid stretch immediately adjacent to the SRF homologous domain of MCM1 was found to be important for activation of alpha-specific genes in alpha cells. Mutants lacking the acidic stretch confer higher expression from an alpha-specific UAS in a cells in addition to lower expression in alpha cells, suggesting that negative regulation at this site occurs in a cells, in addition to the well-documented positive regulation in alpha cells.},

We report that budding yeast permanently escape pheromone-induced cell-cycle arrest when experiencing a deceptive mating attempt, i.e., not reaching their putative partner within reasonable time. This acquired behavior depends on super-assembly and inactivation of the G1/S inhibitor Whi3, which liberates the G1 cyclin Cln3 from translational inhibition. Super-assembly of Whi3 is a slow response to pheromone, driven by polyQ and polyN domains, counteracted by Hsp70, and stable over generations. Unlike prion aggregates, Whi3 super-assemblies are not inherited mitotically but segregate to the mother cell. We propose that such polyQ- and polyN-based elements, termed here mnemons, act as cellular memory devices to encode previous environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The het-s locus of Podospora anserina is a heterokaryon incompatibility locus. The coexpression of the antagonistic het-s and het-S alleles triggers a lethal reaction that prevents the formation of viable heterokaryons. Strains that contain the het-s allele can display two different phenotypes, [Het-s] or [Het-s*], according to their reactivity in incompatibility. The detection in these phenotypically distinct strains of a protein expressed from the het-s gene indicates that the difference in reactivity  depends on a posttranslational difference between two forms of the polypeptide encoded by the het-s gene. This posttranslational modification does not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the protein in SDS/PAGE. Several results suggest a similarity of behavior between the protein encoded by the het-s gene and prions. The [Het-s] character can propagate in [Het-s*] strains as an infectious agent, producing a [Het-s*] [-{\&}gt;] [Het-s] transition, independently of protein synthesis. Expression of the [Het-s] character requires a functional het-s gene. The protein present in [Het-s] strains is more resistant to proteinase K than that present in [Het-s*] mycelium. Furthermore, overexpression of the het-s gene increases the frequency of the transition from [Het-s*] to [Het-s]. We propose that this transition is the consequence of a self-propagating conformational modification of the protein mediated by the formation of complexes between the two different forms of the polypeptide.},

abstract = {The metacaspase Mca1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae displays a Q/N-rich region at its N-terminus reminiscent of yeast prion proteins. In this study, we show that the ability of Mca1 to form insoluble aggregates is modulated by a peptide stretch preceding its putative prion-forming domain. Based on its genomic locus, three potential translational start sites of Mca1 can give rise to two slightly different long Mca1 proteins or a short version, Mca1(451/453) and Mca1(432,) respectively, although under normal physiological conditions Mca1(432) is the predominant form expressed. All Mca1 variants exhibit the Q/N-rich regions, while only the long variants Mca1(451/453) share an extra stretch of 19 amino acids at their N-terminal end. Strikingly, only long versions of Mca1 but not Mca1(432) revealed pronounced aggregation in vivo and displayed prion-like properties when fused to the C-terminal domain of Sup35 suggesting that the N-terminal peptide element promotes the conformational switch of Mca1 protein into an insoluble state. Transfer of the 19 N-terminal amino acid stretch of Mca1(451) to the N-terminus of firefly luciferase resulted in increased aggregation of luciferase, suggesting a protein destabilizing function of the peptide element. We conclude that the aggregation propensity of the potential yeast prion protein Mca1 in vivo is strongly accelerated by a short peptide segment preceding its Q/N-rich region and we speculate that such a conformational switch might occur in vivo via the usage of alternative translational start sites.},

We searched for new prions of yeast by fusing random segments of yeast DNA to SUP35MC, encoding the Sup35 protein lacking its own prion domain, selecting clones in which Sup35MC function was impaired. Three different clones contained parts of the Q/N-rich amino-terminal domain of Mca1p/Yca1p with the Sup35 part of the fusion protein partially inactive. This inactivity was dominant, segregated 4:0 in meiosis, and was efficiently transferred by cytoplasmic mixing. The inactivity was cured by overexpression of Hsp104, but the prion could arise again in the cured strain (reversible curing). Overproduction of the Mca1 N-terminal domain induced the de novo appearance of the prion form of the fusion. The prion state, which we name [MCA], was transmitted to the chromosomally encoded Mca1p based on genetic, cytological and biochemical tests.},

We show here that Podospora anserina strains mutated in PaASK1, a MAPKKK of the MEK family, are impaired in the development of crippled growth, a cell degeneration process caused by C, a nonconventional infectious element. They also display defects in mycelium pigmentation, differentiation of aerial hyphae, and making of fruiting bodies, three hallmarks of cell differentiation during stationary phase in P. anserina. Overexpression of PaASK1 results in exacerbation of crippled growth. PaASK1 is a large protein of 1832 amino acids with several domains, including a region rich in proline and a 60-amino-acid-long polyglutamine stretch. Deletion analysis reveals that the polyglutamine stretch is dispensable for PaASK1 activity, whereas the region that contains the prolines is essential but insufficient to promote full activity. We discuss a model based on the hysteresis of a signal transduction cascade to account for the role of PaASK1 in both cell degeneration and stationary-phase cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Some mutant strains of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina spontaneously present a growth impairment, which has been called Crippled Growth (CG). CG is caused by a cytoplasmic and infectious factor, C. C is efficiently transmitted during mitosis but is not transmitted to the progeny after sexual crosses. C is induced by stationary phase and cured by various means, most of which stress the cells. Translational accuracy is shown to tightly regulate the propagation of C during the active growth period, because its propagation in dividing hyphae is restricted to cells that display an increased translational accuracy. However, induction of C in stationary phase proceeds independently from the translational accuracy status of the strain. CG does not seem to be accompanied by mitochondrial DNA modifications, although C activates the action of the Determinant of Senescence, another cytoplasmic and infectious element, which causes a disorganization of the mitochondrial genome. In addition, presence of C drastically modifies the spectrum of the mitochondrial DNA rearrangements in AS6-5 mat- cultures during Senescence. C seems to belong to the growing list of unconventional genetic elements. The biological significance of such elements is discussed.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many toxic and lethal variants of the [PSI+] and [URE3] prions have been identified in laboratory strains, although some commonly studied variants do not seem to impair cell growth. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed four major clades of S. cerevisiae that share histories of two prion proteins and largely correspond to different ecological niches of yeast. The [PIN+] prion was most prevalent in commercialized niches, infrequent among wine/vineyard strains, and not observed in ancestral isolates. As previously reported, the [PSI+] and [URE3] prions are not found in any of these strains. Patterns of heterozygosity revealed genetic mosaicism and indicated extensive outcrossing among divergent strains in commercialized environments. In contrast, ancestral isolates were all homozygous and wine/vineyard strains were closely related to each other and largely homozygous. Cellular growth patterns were highly variable within and among clades, although ancestral isolates were the most efficient sporulators and domesticated strains showed greater tendencies for flocculation. [PIN+]-infected strains had a significantly higher likelihood of polyploidy, showed a higher propensity for flocculation compared to uninfected strains, and had higher sporulation efficiencies compared to domesticated, uninfected strains. Extensive phenotypic variability among strains from different environments suggests that S. cerevisiae is a niche generalist and that most wild strains are able to switch from asexual to sexual and from unicellular to multicellular growth in response to environmental conditions. Our data suggest that outbreeding and multicellular growth patterns adapted for domesticated environments are ecological risk factors for the [PIN+] prion in wild yeast.},

Polymeric form of prion protein (PrP), PrP(Sc), is implicated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Recently, it was shown that the monomeric cellular form of PrP (PrP(C)), located on the neuron surface, binds A$\beta$ oligomers (and possibly other $\beta$-rich conformers) via the PrP(23-27) and PrP(90-110) segments, acting as A$\beta$ receptor. On the other hand, PrP(Sc) polymers efficiently bind to A$\beta$ monomers and accelerate their oligomerization. To identify specific PrP sequences that are essential for the interaction between PrP polymers and A$\beta$ peptide, we have co-expressed A$\beta$ and PrP (or its shortened derivatives), fused to different fluorophores, in the yeast cell. Our data show that the 90-110 and 28-89 regions of PrP control the binding of proteinase-resistant PrP polymers to the A$\beta$ peptide, whereas the 23-27 segment of PrP is dispensable for this interaction. This indicates that the set of PrP fragments involved in the interaction with A$\beta$ depends on PrP conformational state.},

abstract = {Prions are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases by an entirely novel mechanism. Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion protein (PrP). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie of sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans are among the most notable prion diseases. Prions are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified protein (PrPSc). The normal, cellular PrP (PrPC) is converted into PrPSc through a posttranslational process during which it acquires a high {\{}beta{\}}-sheet content. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence of the chromosomal PrP gene of the mammals in which it last replicated. In contrast to pathogens carrying a nucleic acid genome, prions appear to encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of PrPSc. Transgenetic studies argue that PrPSc acts as a template upon which PrPC is refolded into a nascent PrPSc molecule through a process facilitated by another protein. Miniprions generated in transgenic mice expressing PrP, in which nearly half of the residues were deleted, exhibit unique biological properties and should facilitate structural studies of PrPSc. While knowledge about prions has profound implications for studies of the structural plasticity of proteins, investigations of prion diseases suggest that new strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders may also find application in the more common degenerative diseases.},

abstract = {The [PSI(+)] yeast prion is formed when Sup35 misfolds into amyloid aggregates. [PSI(+)], like other yeast prions, is dependent on the molecular chaperone Hsp104, which severs the prion seeds so that they pass on as the yeast cells divide. Surprisingly, however, overexpression of Hsp104 also cures [PSI(+)]. Several models have been proposed to explain this effect: inhibition of severing, asymmetric segregation of the seeds between mother and daughter cells, and dissolution of the prion seeds. First, we found that neither the kinetics of curing nor the heterogeneity in the distribution of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled Sup35 foci in partially cured yeast cells is compatible with Hsp104 overexpression curing [PSI(+)] by inhibiting severing. Second, we ruled out the asymmetric segregation model by showing that the extent of curing was essentially the same in mother and daughter cells and that the fluorescent foci did not distribute asymmetrically, but rather, there was marked loss of foci in both mother and daughter cells. These results suggest that Hsp104 overexpression cures [PSI(+)] by dissolution of the prion seeds in a two-step process. First, trimming of the prion seeds by Hsp104 reduces their size, and second, their amyloid core is eliminated, most likely by proteolysis.},

On the basis of 134 intra- and intermolecular experimental distance restraints, we find that HET-s(218-289) forms a left-handed beta solenoid, with each molecule forming two helical windings, a compact hydrophobic core, at least 23 hydrogen bonds, three salt bridges, and two asparagine ladders. The structure is likely to have broad implications for understanding the infectious amyloid state.},

abstract = {The highly ordered and reproducible structure of the fungal prion HET-s makes it an excellent model system for studying the inherent properties of prions, self-propagating infectious proteins that have been implicated in a number of fatal diseases. In particular, the HET-s prion-forming domain readily folds into a relatively complex two-rung $\beta$-solenoid amyloid. The faithful self-propagation of this fold involves a diverse array of inter- and intramolecular structural features. These features include a long flexible loop connecting the two rungs, buried polar residues, salt bridges, and asparagine ladders. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray fiber diffraction to probe the relative importance of these features for the formation of $\beta$-solenoid structure, as well as the cumulative effects of multiple mutations. Using fibrillization kinetics and chemical stability assays, we have determined the biophysical effects of our mutations on the assembly and stability of the prion-forming domain. We have found that a diversity of structural features provides a level of redundancy that allows robust folding and stability even in the face of significant sequence alterations and suboptimal environmental conditions. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the structural interactions necessary for self-propagation. Propagation of prion structure seems to require an obligatory level of complexity that may not be reproducible in short peptide models.},

abstract = {[Het-s] is a prion from the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina and corresponds to a self-perpetuating amyloid aggregate of the HET-s protein. This prion protein is involved in a fungal self/non-self discrimination process termed heterokaryon incompatibility corresponding to a cell death reaction occurring upon fusion of genetically unlike strains. Two antagonistic allelic variants of this protein exist: HET-s, the prion form of which corresponds to [Het-s] and HET-S, incapable of prion formation. Fusion of a [Het-s] and HET-S strain triggers the incompatibility reaction, so that interaction of HET-S with the [Het-s] prion leads to cell death. HET-s and HET-S are highly homologous two domain proteins with a N-terminal globular domain termed HeLo and a C-terminal unstructured prion forming domain (PFD). The structure of the prion form of the HET-s PFD has been solved by solid state NMR and corresponds to a very well ordered $\beta$-solenoid fold with a triangular hydrophobic core. The ability to form this $\beta$-solenoid fold is retained in a distant homolog of HET-s from another fungal species. A model for the mechanism of [Het-s]/HET-S incompatibility has been proposed. It is believe that when interacting with the [Het-s] prion seed, the HET-S C-terminal region adopts the $\beta$-solenoid fold. This would act as a conformational switch to induce refolding and activation of the HeLo domain which then would exert its toxicity by a yet unknown mechanism.},

abstract = {Self-perpetuating amyloid-based protein isoforms (prions) transmit neurodegenerative diseases in mammals and phenotypic traits in yeast. Although mechanisms that control species specificity of prion transmission are poorly understood, studies of closely related orthologues of yeast prion protein Sup35 demonstrate that cross-species prion transmission is modulated by both genetic (specific sequence elements) and epigenetic (prion variants, or 'strains') factors. Depending on the prion variant, the species barrier could be controlled at the level of either heterologous co-aggregation or conversion of the aggregate-associated heterologous protein into a prion polymer. Sequence divergence influences cross-species transmission of different prion variants in opposing ways. The ability of a heterologous prion domain to either faithfully reproduce or irreversibly switch the variant-specific prion patterns depends on both sequence divergence and the prion variant. Sequence variations within different modules of prion domains contribute to transmission barriers in different cross-species combinations. Individual amino acid substitutions within short amyloidogenic stretches drastically alter patterns of cross-species prion conversion, implicating these stretches as major determinants of species specificity.},

abstract = {Efficiency of interspecies prion transmission decreases as the primary structures of the infectious proteins diverge. Yet, a single prion protein can misfold into multiple infectious conformations, and such differences in "strain conformation" also alter infection specificity. Here, we explored the relationship between prion strains and species barriers by creating distinct synthetic prion forms of the yeast prion protein Sup35. We identified a strain conformation of Sup35 that allows transmission from the S. cerevisiae (Sc) Sup35 to the highly divergent C. albicans (Ca) Sup35 both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, cross-species transmission leads to a novel Ca strain that in turn can infect the Sc protein. Structural studies reveal strain-specific conformational differences in regions of the prion domain that are involved in intermolecular contacts. Our findings support a model whereby strain conformation is the critical determinant of cross-species prion transmission while primary structure affects transmission specificity by altering the spectrum of preferred amyloid conformations.},

The abilities of prions to replicate, form structurally distinct strains, and establish and overcome transmission barriers between species are poorly understood. We exploit surface-bound peptides to overcome complexities of investigating such problems in solution. For the yeast prion Sup35, we find that the switch to the prion state is controlled with exquisite specificity by small elements of primary sequence. Strikingly, these same sequence elements govern the formation of distinct self-perpetuating conformations (prion strains) and determine species-specific seeding activities. A Sup35 chimaera that traverses the transmission barrier between two yeast species possesses the critical sequence elements from both. Using this chimaera, we show that the influence of environment and mutations on the formation of species-specific strains is driven by selective recognition of either sequence element. Thus, critical aspects of prion conversion are enciphered by subtle differences between small, highly specific recognition elements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of amyloid diseases involve deposition of extracellular protein aggregates, which are implicated in mechanisms of cell damage and death. However, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we use the yeast prion protein Ure2 as a generic model to investigate how amyloid-like protein aggregates can enter mammalian cells and convey cytotoxicity. The effect of three different states of Ure2 protein (native dimer, protofibrils and mature fibrils) was tested on four mammalian cell lines (SH-SY5Y, MES23.5, HEK-293 and HeLa) when added extracellularly to the medium. Immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody against Ure2 showed that all three protein states could enter the four cell lines. In each case, protofibrils significantly inhibited the growth of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, fibrils showed less toxicity than protofibrils, while the native state had no effect on cell growth. This suggests that the structural differences between the three protein states lead to their different effects upon cells. Protofibrils of Ure2 increased membrane conductivity, altered calcium homeostasis, and ultimately induced apoptosis. The use of standard inhibitors suggested uptake into mammalian cells might occur via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In order to investigate this further, we used the chicken DT40 B cell line DKOR, which allows conditional expression of clathrin. Uptake into the DKOR cell-line was reduced when clathrin expression was repressed suggesting similarities between the mechanism of PrP uptake and the mechanism observed here for Ure2.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results provide insight into the mechanisms by which amyloid aggregates may cause pathological effects in prion and amyloid diseases.},

Rapamycin causes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Gln3p, thereby activating nitrogen catabolite repressible-sensitive genes. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of this process is lacking. In this study, we show that Tor1p physically interacts with Gln3p. An intact TOR kinase domain is essential for the phosphorylation of Gln3p, inhibition of Gln3p nuclear entry and repression of Gln3p-dependent transcription. In contrast, at least two distinct protein phosphatases, Pph3p and the Tap42p-dependent phosphatases, are involved in the activation of Gln3p. The yeast pro-prion protein Ure2p binds to both hyper- and hypo-phosphorylated Gln3p. In contrast to the free Gln3p, the Ure2p-bound Gln3p is signifcantly resistant to dephosphorylation. Taken together, these results reveal a tripartite regulatory mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Gln3p is regulated.},

Here, we show that Ssa1p increases the lag time of Ure2p fibril formation in vitro in the presence or absence of nucleotide. The presence of the HSP40 co-chaperone Ydj1p has an additive effect on the inhibition of Ure2p fibril formation, whereas the Ydj1p H34Q mutant shows reduced inhibition alone and in combination with Ssa1p. In order to investigate the structural basis of these effects, we constructed and tested an Ssa1p mutant lacking the ATPase domain, as well as a series of C-terminal truncation mutants. The results indicate that Ssa1p can bind to Ure2p and delay fibril formation even in the absence of the ATPase domain, but interaction of Ure2p with the substrate-binding domain is strongly influenced by the C-terminal lid region. Dynamic light scattering, quartz crystal microbalance assays, pull-down assays and kinetic analysis indicate that Ssa1p interacts with both native Ure2p and fibril seeds, and reduces the rate of Ure2p fibril elongation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results provide new insights into the structural and mechanistic basis for inhibition of Ure2p fibril formation by Ssa1p and Ydj1p.},

The role of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) product of the URE2 gene involved in resistance of S. cerevisiae to a broad range of heavy metals was investigated. Glutathione peroxidase activity, previously reported for the Ure2p protein, was unaffected in cell-free extracts of an ure2$\Delta$ mutant of S. cerevisiae. Glutathione levels in the ure2$\Delta$ mutant were lowered about threefold compared to the isogenic wild-type strain but, as in the wild-type strain, increased 2-2.5-fold upon addition of either arsenate (As(V)) or arsenite (As(III)). However, lack of URE2 specifically caused sensitivity to arsenite but not to arsenate. The protective role of URE2 against arsenite depended solely on the GST-encoding 3'-end portion of the gene. The nitrogen source used for growth was suggested to be an important determinant of arsenite toxicity, in keeping with non-enzymatic roles of the URE2 gene product in GATA-type regulation.},

The limited availability of defective rnq1 alleles impedes the study of its structure-function relationship by genetic analysis. In this study, we isolated rnq1 mutants that are defective in the stable maintenance of the [PIN+] prion. Since there is no rnq1 phenotype available that is applicable to a direct selection or screening for loss-of-function rnq1 mutants, we took advantage of a prion inhibitory agent, Rnq1$\Delta$100, to develop a color-based genetic screen. Rnq1$\Delta$100 eliminates the [PSI+] prion in the [PIN+] state but not in the [pin-] state. This allows us to find loss-of-[PIN+] rnq1 mutants as white [PSI+] colonies. Nine rnq1 mutants with single-amino-acid substitutions were defined. These mutations impaired the stable maintenance of [PIN+] and, as a consequence, were also partially defective in the de novo induction of ...},

abstract = {In-frame stop codons normally signal termination during mRNA translation, but they can be read as 'sense' (readthrough) depending on their context, comprising the 6 nt preceding and following the stop codon. To identify novel contexts directing readthrough, under-represented 5' and 3' stop codon contexts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified by genome-wide survey in silico. In contrast with the nucleotide bias 3' of the stop codon, codon bias in the two codon positions 5' of the termination codon showed no correlation with known effects on stop codon readthrough. However, individually, poor 5' and 3' context elements were equally as effective in promoting stop codon readthrough in vivo, readthrough which in both cases responded identically to changes in release factor concentration. A novel method analysing specific nucleotide combinations in the 3' context region revealed positions +1,2,3,5 and +1,2,3,6 after the stop codon were most predictive of termination efficiency. Downstream of yeast open reading frames (ORFs), further in-frame stop codons were significantly over-represented at the +1, +2 and +3 codon positions after the ORF, acting to limit readthrough. Thus selection against stop codon readthrough is a dominant force acting on 3', but not on 5', nucleotides, with detectable selection on nucleotides as far downstream as +6 nucleotides. The approaches described can be employed to define potential readthrough contexts for any genome.},

abstract = {The [PSI(+)] prion may enhance evolvability by revealing previously cryptic genetic variation, but it is unclear whether such evolvability properties could be favored by natural selection. Sex inhibits the evolution of other putative evolvability mechanisms, such as mutator alleles. This paper explores whether sex also prevents natural selection from favoring modifier alleles that facilitate [PSI(+)] formation. Sex may permit the spread of "cheater" alleles that acquire the benefits of [PSI(+)] through mating without incurring the cost of producing [PSI(+)] at times when it is not adaptive. Using recent quantitative estimates of the frequency of sex in Saccharomyces paradoxus, we calculate that natural selection for evolvability can drive the evolution of the [PSI(+)] system, so long as yeast populations occasionally require complex adaptations involving synergistic epistasis between two loci. If adaptations are always simple and require substitution at only a single locus, then the [PSI(+)] system is not favored by natural selection. Obligate sex might inhibit the evolution of [PSI(+)]-like systems in other species.},

abstract = {Multiple yeast prions have been identified that result from the structural conversion of proteins into a self-propagating amyloid form. Amyloid-based prion activity in yeast requires a series of discrete steps. First, the prion protein must form an amyloid nucleus that can recruit and structurally convert additional soluble proteins. Subsequently, maintenance of the prion during cell division requires fragmentation of these aggregates to create new heritable propagons. For the yeast prion protein Sup35, these different activities are encoded for by different regions of Sup35's prion domain. An N-terminal glutamine/asparagine-rich nucleation domain is required for nucleation and fiber growth, while an adjacent oligopeptide repeat domain is largely dispensable for prion nucleation and fiber growth, but required for chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. Although prion activity of glutamine/asparagine-rich proteins is predominantly determined by amino acid composition, the nucleation and oligopeptide repeat domains of Sup35 have distinct compositional requirements. Here, we quantitatively define these compositional requirements in vivo. We show that aromatic residues strongly promote both prion formation and chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. By contrast, non-aromatic hydrophobic residues strongly promote prion formation, but inhibit prion propagation. These results provide insight into why some aggregation-prone proteins are unable to propagate as prions.},

abstract = {Sup35p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can form the [PSI+] prion, an infectious amyloid in which the protein is largely inactive. The part of Sup35p that forms the amyloid is the region normally involved in control of mRNA turnover. The formation of [PSI+] by Sup35p's from other yeasts has been interpreted to imply that the prion-forming ability of Sup35p is conserved in evolution, and thus of survival/fitness/evolutionary value to these organisms. We surveyed a larger number of yeast and fungal species by the same criteria as used previously and find that the Sup35p from many species cannot form prions. [PSI+] could be formed by the Sup35p from Candida albicans, Candida maltosa, Debaromyces hansenii, and Kluyveromyces lactis, but orders of magnitude less often than the S. cerevisiae Sup35p converts to the prion form. The Sup35s from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Ashbya gossypii clearly do not form [PSI+]. We were also unable to detect [PSI+] formation by the Sup35ps from Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Magnaporthe grisea, Ustilago maydis, or Cryptococcus neoformans. Each of two C. albicans SUP35 alleles can form [PSI+], but transmission from one to the other is partially blocked. These results suggest that the prion-forming ability of Sup35p is not a conserved trait, but is an occasional deleterious side effect of a protein domain conserved for another function.},

abstract = {Fermented beverages and foods have played a significant role in most societies worldwide for millennia. To better understand how the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main fermenting agent, evolved along this historical and expansion process, we analysed the genetic diversity among 651 strains from 56 different geographical origins, worldwide. Their genotyping at 12 microsatellite loci revealed 575 distinct genotypes organized in subgroups of yeast types, i.e. bread, beer, wine, sake. Some of these groups presented unexpected relatedness: Bread strains displayed a combination of alleles intermediate between beer and wine strains, and strains used for rice wine and sake were most closely related to beer and bread strains. However, up to 28{\%} of genetic diversity between these technological groups was associated with geographical differences which suggests local domestications. Focusing on wine yeasts, a group of Lebanese strains were basal in an F(ST) tree, suggesting a Mesopotamia-based origin of most wine strains. In Europe, migration of wine strains occurred through the Danube Valley, and around the Mediterranean Sea. An approximate Bayesian computation approach suggested a postglacial divergence (most probable period 10,000-12,000 bp). As our results suggest intimate association between man and wine yeast across centuries, we hypothesize that yeast followed man and vine migrations as a commensal member of grapevine flora.},

abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI(+)] has been implicated in the generation of novel phenotypes by a mechanism involving a reduction in translation fidelity causing readthrough of naturally occurring stop codons. Some [PSI(+)] associated phenotypes may also be generated due to readthrough of inactivating stop codon mutations (ISCMs). Using next generation sequencing we have sequenced the genomes of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that are commonly used for the study of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion. We have identified approximately 26,000 and 6,500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains 74-D694 and G600 respectively, compared to reference strain S288C. In addition to SNPs that produce non-synonymous amino acid changes we have also identified a number of SNPs that cause potential ISCMs in these strains, one of which we show is associated with a [PSI(+)]-dependent stress resistance phenotype in strain G600. We identified twenty-two potential ISCMs in strain 74-D694, present in genes involved in a variety of cellular processes including nitrogen metabolism, signal transduction and oxidative stress response. The presence of ISCMs in a subset of these genes provides possible explanations for previously identified [PSI(+)]-associated phenotypes in this strain. A comparison of ISCMs in strains G600 and 74-D694 with S. cerevisiae strains sequenced as part of the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project (SGRP) shows much variation in the generation of strain-specific ISCMs and suggests this process is possible under complex genetic control. Additionally we have identified a major difference in the abilities of strains G600 and 74-D694 to grow at elevated temperatures. However, this difference appears unrelated to novel SNPs identified in strain 74-D694 present in proteins involved in the heat shock response, but may be attributed to other SNP differences in genes previously identified as playing a role in high temperature growth.},

Hsp104 also remodels amyloid in vitro and promotes propagation of amyloid prions in yeast, but ClpB does neither, leading to a view that Hsp104 evolved these activities. Although biochemical analyses identified disaggregation machinery components required for resolubilizing proteins, interactions among these components required for in vivo functions are not clearly defined. We express prokaryotic chaperones in yeast to address these issues and find ClpB supports both prion propagation and thermotolerance in yeast if it is modified to interact with yeast Hsp70 or if E. coli Hsp70 and its cognate nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) are present. Our findings show prion propagation and thermotolerance in yeast minimally require cooperation of species-specific Hsp100, Hsp70, and NEF with yeast Hsp40. The functions of this machinery in prion propagation were directed primarily by Hsp40 Sis1p, while thermotolerance relied mainly on Hsp40 Ydj1p. Our results define cooperative interactions among these components that are specific or interchangeable across life kingdoms and imply Hsp100 family disaggregases possess intrinsic amyloid remodeling activity.},

abstract = {Molecular chaperones play a significant role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. Indeed, some protein conformational disorders have been linked to changes in the chaperone network. Curiously, in yeast, chaperones also play a role in promoting prion maintenance and propagation. While many amyloidogenic proteins are associated with disease in mammals, yeast prion proteins, and their ability to undergo conformational conversion into a prion state, are proposed to play a functional role in yeast biology. The chaperone Hsp104, a AAA+ ATPase, is essential for yeast prion propagation. Hsp104 fragments large prion aggregates to generate a population of smaller oligomers that can more readily convert soluble monomer and be transmitted to daughter cells. Here, we show that the middle (M) domain of Hsp104, and its mobility, plays an integral part in prion propagation. We generated and characterized mutations in the M-domain of Hsp104 that are predicted to stabilize either a repressed or de-repressed conformation of the M-domain (by analogy to ClpB in bacteria). We show that the predicted stabilization of the repressed conformation inhibits general chaperone activity. Mutation to the de-repressed conformation, however, has differential effects on ATP hydrolysis and disaggregation, suggesting that the M-domain is involved in coupling these two activities. Interestingly, we show that changes in the M-domain differentially affect the propagation of different variants of the [PSI+] and [RNQ+] prions, which indicates that some prion variants are more sensitive to changes in the M-domain mobility than others. Thus, we provide evidence that regulation of the M-domain of Hsp104 is critical for efficient prion propagation. This shows the importance of elucidating the function of the M-domain in order to understand the role of Hsp104 in the propagation of different prions and prion variants.},

Furthermore, insertion of lgfp downstream of a phage response promoter conferred phage resistance on E. coli. Such engineered gene silencers could act as components of biological networks capable of functioning with suitable promoter in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and human cells to control gene expression.

At the molecular level, the FG domains of five nucleoporins anchored at the NPC center form a cohesive meshwork of filaments through hydrophobic interactions, which involve phenylalanines in FG motifs and are dispersed by aliphatic alcohols. In contrast, the FG domains of four peripherally anchored nucleoporins are generally noncohesive. The results support a two-gate model of NPC architecture featuring a central diffusion gate formed by a meshwork of cohesive FG nucleoporin filaments and a peripheral gate formed by repulsive FG nucleoporin filaments.},

abstract = {Prion proteins can adopt self-propagating alternative conformations that account for the infectious nature of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and the epigenetic inheritance of certain traits in yeast. Recent evidence suggests a similar propagation of misfolded proteins in the spreading of pathology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Currently there is only a limited number of animal model systems available to study the mechanisms that underlie the cell-to-cell transmission of aggregation-prone proteins. Here, we have established a new metazoan model in Caenorhabditis elegans expressing the prion domain NM of the cytosolic yeast prion protein Sup35, in which aggregation and toxicity are dependent upon the length of oligopeptide repeats in the glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich N-terminus. NM forms multiple classes of highly toxic aggregate species and co-localizes to autophagy-related vesicles that transport the prion domain from the site of expression to adjacent tissues. This is associated with a profound cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous disruption of mitochondrial integrity, embryonic and larval arrest, developmental delay, widespread tissue defects, and loss of organismal proteostasis. Our results reveal that the Sup35 prion domain exhibits prion-like properties when expressed in the multicellular organism C. elegans and adapts to different requirements for propagation that involve the autophagy-lysosome pathway to transmit cytosolic aggregation-prone proteins between tissues.},

abstract = {The fission (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and budding (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) yeasts have served as excellent models for many seminal discoveries in eukaryotic biology. In these organisms, genes are deleted or tagged easily by transforming cells with PCR-generated DNA inserts, flanked by short (50-100bp) regions of gene homology. These PCR reactions use especially designed long primers, which, in addition to the priming sites, carry homology for gene targeting. Primer design follows a fixed method but is tedious and time-consuming especially when done for a large number of genes. To automate this process, we developed the Python-based Genome Retrieval Script (GRS), an easily customizable open-source script for genome analysis. Using GRS, we created PRIMED, the complete PRIMEr D atabase for deleting and C-terminal tagging genes in the main S. pombe and five of the most commonly used S. cerevisiae strains. Because of the importance of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in many biological processes, we also included the deletion primer set for these features in each genome. PRIMED are accurate and comprehensive and are provided as downloadable Excel files, removing the need for future primer design, especially for large-scale functional analyses. Furthermore, the open-source GRS can be used broadly to retrieve genome information from custom or other annotated genomes, thus providing a suitable platform for building other genomic tools by the yeast or other research communities.},

abstract = {The function of yeast Rap1 as an activator in transcription, a repressor at silencer elements, and as a major component of the shelterin-like complex at telomeres requires the known high-affinity and specific interaction of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) with its recognition sequences. In addition to a high-affinity one-to-one complex with its DNA recognition site, Rap1(DBD) also forms lower affinity complexes with higher stoichiometries on DNA. We proposed that this originates from the ability of Rap1(DBD) to access at least two DNA-binding modes. In this work, we show that Rap1(DBD) binds in multiple binding modes to recognition sequences that contain different spacer lengths between the hemi-sites. We also provide evidence that in the singly-ligated complex Rap1(DBD) binds quite differently to these sequences. Rap1(DBD) also binds to a single half-site but does so using the alternative DNA-binding mode where only a single Myb-like domain interacts with DNA. We found that all arrangements of Rap1 sites tested are represented within the telomeric sequence and our data suggest that at telomeres Rap1 might form a nucleoprotein complex with a heterogeneous distribution of bound states.},

abstract = {Prions are self-templating protein conformers that replicate by recruitment and conversion of homotypic proteins into growing protein aggregates. Originally identified as causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, increasing evidence now suggests that prion-like phenomena are more common in nature than previously anticipated. In contrast to fungal prions that replicate in the cytoplasm, propagation of mammalian prions derived from the precursor protein PrP is confined to the cell membrane or endocytic vesicles. Here we demonstrate that cytosolic protein aggregates can also behave as infectious entities in mammalian cells. When expressed in the mammalian cytosol, protein aggregates derived from the prion domain NM of yeast translation termination factor Sup35 persistently propagate and invade neighboring cells, thereby inducing a self-perpetuating aggregation state of NM. Cell contact is required for efficient infection. Aggregates can also be induced in primary astrocytes, neurons, and organotypic cultures, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not specific to immortalized cells. Our data have important implications for understanding prion-like phenomena of protein aggregates associated with human diseases and for the growing number of amyloidogenic proteins discovered in mammals.},

Eleven (11) individual methods are combined and produce AMYLPRED2, a publicly, freely available web tool to academic users (http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/AMYLPRED2), for the consensus prediction of amyloidogenic determinants/'aggregation-prone' peptides in proteins, from sequence alone. The performance of AMYLPRED2 indicates that it functions better than individual aggregation-prediction algorithms, as perhaps expected. AMYLPRED2 is a useful tool for identifying amyloid-forming regions in proteins that are associated with several conformational diseases, called amyloidoses, such as Altzheimer's, Parkinson's, prion diseases and type II diabetes. It may also be useful for understanding the properties of protein folding and misfolding and for helping to the control of protein aggregation/solubility in biotechnology (recombinant proteins forming bacterial inclusion bodies) and biotherapeutics (monoclonal antibodies and biopharmaceutical proteins).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions.

RESULTS: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff > -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD.

CONCLUSION: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloid fibrillar aggregates of proteins or polypeptides are known to be associated with many human diseases. Recent studies suggest that short protein regions trigger this aggregation. Thus, identifying these short peptides is critical for understanding diseases and finding potential therapeutic targets.

RESULTS: We propose a method, named Pafig (Prediction of amyloid fibril-forming segments) based on support vector machines, to identify the hexpeptides associated with amyloid fibrillar aggregates. The features of Pafig were obtained by a two-round selection from AAindex. Using a 10-fold cross validation test on Hexpepset dataset, Pafig performed well with regards to overall accuracy of 81{\%} and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.63. Pafig was used to predict the potential fibril-forming hexpeptides in all of the 64,000,000 hexpeptides. As a result, approximately 5.08{\%} of hexpeptides showed a high aggregation propensity. In the predicted fibril-forming hexpeptides, the amino acids--alanine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine occurred at the higher frequencies and the amino acids--aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, arginine and praline, appeared with lower frequencies.

CONCLUSION: The performance of Pafig indicates that it is a powerful tool for identifying the hexpeptides associated with fibrillar aggregates and will be useful for large-scale analysis of proteomic data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains.

RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75{\%} of amyloidogenic peptides and 74{\%} of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80{\%} of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72{\%} of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions.

The aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up-to-date collection of annotated 3D protein models generated by automated homology modelling for all sequences in Swiss-Prot and for relevant models organisms. Regular updates ensure that target coverage is complete, that models are built using the most recent sequence and template structure databases, and that improvements in the underlying modelling pipeline are fully utilised. As of September 2008, the database contains 3.4 million entries for 2.7 million different protein sequences from the UniProt database. SWISS-MODEL Repository allows the users to assess the quality of the models in the database, search for alternative template structures, and to build models interactively via SWISS-MODEL Workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/). Annotation of models with functional information and cross-linking with other databases such as the Protein Model Portal (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org) of the PSI Structural Genomics Knowledge Base facilitates the navigation between protein sequence and structure resources.},

abstract = {Protein structure homology modelling has become a routine technique to generate 3D models for proteins when experimental structures are not available. Fully automated servers such as SWISS-MODEL with user-friendly web interfaces generate reliable models without the need for complex software packages or downloading large databases. Here, we describe the latest version of the SWISS-MODEL expert system for protein structure modelling. The SWISS-MODEL template library provides annotation of quaternary structure and essential ligands and co-factors to allow for building of complete structural models, including their oligomeric structure. The improved SWISS-MODEL pipeline makes extensive use of model quality estimation for selection of the most suitable templates and provides estimates of the expected accuracy of the resulting models. The accuracy of the models generated by SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated by the CAMEO system. The new web site allows users to interactively search for templates, cluster them by sequence similarity, structurally compare alternative templates and select the ones to be used for model building. In cases where multiple alternative template structures are available for a protein of interest, a user-guided template selection step allows building models in different functional states. SWISS-MODEL is available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/.},

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer and spongiform encephalopathies, as well as type 2 diabetes and both localized and systemic amyloidosis, are among the conditions that are associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils. Several mathematical tools can rationalize and even predict important parameters of amyloid fibril formation. It is not clear, however, whether such algorithms have predictive powers for in vivo systems, in which protein aggregation is affected by the presence of other biological factors. In this review, we briefly describe the existing algorithms and use them to predict the effects of mutations on the aggregation of specific proteins, for which in vivo experimental data are available. The comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data obtained in vivo is shown for each algorithm and experimental data set, and statistically significant correlations are found in most cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein aggregation correlates with the development of several debilitating human disorders of growing incidence, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. On the biotechnological side, protein production is often hampered by the accumulation of recombinant proteins into aggregates. Thus, the development of methods to anticipate the aggregation properties of polypeptides is receiving increasing attention. AGGRESCAN is a web-based software for the prediction of aggregation-prone segments in protein sequences, the analysis of the effect of mutations on protein aggregation propensities and the comparison of the aggregation properties of different proteins or protein sets.

RESULTS: AGGRESCAN is based on an aggregation-propensity scale for natural amino acids derived from in vivo experiments and on the assumption that short and specific sequence stretches modulate protein aggregation. The algorithm is shown to identify a series of protein fragments involved in the aggregation of disease-related proteins and to predict the effect of genetic mutations on their deposition propensities. It also provides new insights into the differential aggregation properties displayed by globular proteins, natively unfolded polypeptides, amyloidogenic proteins and proteins found in bacterial inclusion bodies.

CONCLUSION: By identifying aggregation-prone segments in proteins, AGGRESCAN http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/ shall facilitate (i) the identification of possible therapeutic targets for anti-depositional strategies in conformational diseases and (ii) the anticipation of aggregation phenomena during storage or recombinant production of bioactive polypeptides or polypeptide sets.},

The propensities of different protein sequences to aggregate into amyloids, how they are enhanced by pathogenic mutations, the presence of aggregation hot spots stabilizing pathological interactions, the establishing of cross-amyloid interactions between co-aggregating proteins, all rely at the molecular level on the stability of the amyloid cross-beta structure.

The server provides other pieces of information, such as intrinsic disorder and secondary structure predictions, that complement the aggregation data. The PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates the stability of putative cross-beta pairings between different sequence stretches. It was re-derived on a larger dataset of globular protein domains. The resulting algorithm was benchmarked on comprehensive peptide and protein test sets, leading to improved, state-of-the-art results with more amyloid forming regions correctly detected at high specificity.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Termination of transcription of short non-coding RNAs is carried out in yeast by the Nab3-Nrd1-Sen1 complex. Nab3 and Nrd1 are hnRNP-like proteins that dimerize and bind RNA with sequence specificity. We show here that an essential region of Nab3 that is predicted to be prion-like based upon its sequence bias, formed amyloid-like filaments. A similar region from Nrd1 also assembled into filaments in vitro. The purified Nab3 domain formed a macroscopic gel whose lattice organization was observed by X-ray fiber diffraction. Filaments were resistant to dissociation in anionic detergent, bound the fluorescent dye thioflavin T, and showed a $\beta$-sheet rich structure by circular dichroism spectroscopy, similar to human amyloid $\beta$ $\omega$$\eta$$\iota$ch served as a reference amyloid. A version of the Nab3 domain with a mutation that impairs its termination function, also formed fibers as observed by electron microscopy. Using a protein fragment interaction assay, the purified Nab3 domain was seen to interact with itself in living yeast. A similar observation was made for full length Nab3. These results suggest that the Nab3 and Nrd1 RNA-binding proteins can attain a complex polymeric form and raise the possibility that this property is important for organizing their functional state during termination. These findings are congruent with recent work showing that RNA binding proteins with low complexity domains form a dynamic subcellular matrix in which RNA metabolism takes place but can also aberrantly yield pathological aggregated particles.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein beta-sheets play a fundamental role in protein structure, function, evolution and bioengineering. Accurate prediction and assembly of protein beta-sheets, however, remains challenging because protein beta-sheets require formation of hydrogen bonds between linearly distant residues. Previous approaches for predicting beta-sheet topological features, such as beta-strand alignments, in general have not exploited the global covariation and constraints characteristic of beta-sheet architectures.

RESULTS: We propose a modular approach to the problem of predicting/assembling protein beta-sheets in a chain by integrating both local and global constraints in three steps. The first step uses recursive neural networks to predict pairing probabilities for all pairs of interstrand beta-residues from profile, secondary structure and solvent accessibility information. The second step applies dynamic programming techniques to these probabilities to derive binding pseudoenergies and optimal alignments between all pairs of beta-strands. Finally, the third step uses graph matching algorithms to predict the beta-sheet architecture of the protein by optimizing the global pseudoenergy while enforcing strong global beta-strand pairing constraints. The approach is evaluated using cross-validation methods on a large non-homologous dataset and yields significant improvements over previous methods.

abstract = {The amino acid sequence rules that specify beta-sheet structure in proteins remain obscure. A subclass of beta-sheet proteins, parallel beta-helices, represent a processive folding of the chain into an elongated topologically simpler fold than globular beta-sheets. In this paper, we present a computational approach that predicts the right-handed parallel beta-helix supersecondary structural motif in primary amino acid sequences by using beta-strand interactions learned from non-beta-helix structures. A program called BETAWRAP (http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/betawrap) implements this method and recognizes each of the seven known parallel beta-helix families, when trained on the known parallel beta-helices from outside that family. BETAWRAP identifies 2,448 sequences among 595,890 screened from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) nonredundant protein database as likely parallel beta-helices. It identifies surprisingly many bacterial and fungal protein sequences that play a role in human infectious disease; these include toxins, virulence factors, adhesins, and surface proteins of Chlamydia, Helicobacteria, Bordetella, Leishmania, Borrelia, Rickettsia, Neisseria, and Bacillus anthracis. Also unexpected was the rarity of the parallel beta-helix fold and its predicted sequences among higher eukaryotes. The computational method introduced here can be called a three-dimensional dynamic profile method because it generates interstrand pairwise correlations from a processive sequence wrap. Such methods may be applicable to recognizing other beta structures for which strand topology and profiles of residue accessibility are well conserved.},

abstract = {Amyloids and prion proteins are clinically and biologically important beta-structures, whose supersecondary structures are difficult to determine by standard experimental or computational means. In addition, significant conformational heterogeneity is known or suspected to exist in many amyloid fibrils. Recent work has indicated the utility of pairwise probabilistic statistics in beta-structure prediction. We develop here a new strategy for beta-structure prediction, emphasizing the determination of beta-strands and pairs of beta-strands as fundamental units of beta-structure. Our program, BETASCAN, calculates likelihood scores for potential beta-strands and strand-pairs based on correlations observed in parallel beta-sheets. The program then determines the strands and pairs with the greatest local likelihood for all of the sequence's potential beta-structures. BETASCAN suggests multiple alternate folding patterns and assigns relative a priori probabilities based solely on amino acid sequence, probability tables, and pre-chosen parameters. The algorithm compares favorably with the results of previous algorithms (BETAPRO, PASTA, SALSA, TANGO, and Zyggregator) in beta-structure prediction and amyloid propensity prediction. Accurate prediction is demonstrated for experimentally determined amyloid beta-structures, for a set of known beta-aggregates, and for the parallel beta-strands of beta-helices, amyloid-like globular proteins. BETASCAN is able both to detect beta-strands with higher sensitivity and to detect the edges of beta-strands in a richly beta-like sequence. For two proteins (Abeta and Het-s), there exist multiple sets of experimental data implying contradictory structures; BETASCAN is able to detect each competing structure as a potential structure variant. The ability to correlate multiple alternate beta-structures to experiment opens the possibility of computational investigation of prion strains and structural heterogeneity of amyloid. BETASCAN is publicly accessible on the Web at http://betascan.csail.mit.edu.},

abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI+] results from self-propagating aggregates of Sup35p. De novo formation of [PSI+] requires an additional non-Mendelian trait, thought to result from a prion form of one or more unknown proteins. We find that the Gln/Asn-rich prion domains of two proteins, New1p and Rnq1p, can control susceptibility to [PSI+] induction as well as enhance aggregation of a human glutamine expansion disease protein. [PSI+] inducibility results from gain-of-function properties of New1p and Rnq1p aggregates rather than from inactivation of the normal proteins. These studies suggest a molecular basis for the epigenetic control of [PSI+] inducibility and may reveal a broader role for this phenomenon in the physiology of protein aggregation.},

abstract = {Evolution depends on the manner in which genetic variation is translated into new phenotypes. There has been much debate about whether organisms might have specific mechanisms for "evolvability," which would generate heritable phenotypic variation with adaptive value and could act to enhance the rate of evolution. Capacitor systems, which allow the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation and release it under stressful conditions, might provide such a mechanism. In yeast, the prion [PSI(+)] exposes a large array of previously hidden genetic variation, and the phenotypes it thereby produces are advantageous roughly 25{\%} of the time. The notion that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism for evolvability would be strengthened if the frequency of its appearance increased with stress. That is, a system that mediates even the haphazard appearance of new phenotypes, which have a reasonable chance of adaptive value would be beneficial if it were deployed at times when the organism is not well adapted to its environment. In an unbiased, high-throughput, genome-wide screen for factors that modify the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction, signal transducers and stress response genes were particularly prominent. Furthermore, prion induction increased by as much as 60-fold when cells were exposed to various stressful conditions, such as oxidative stress (H2O2) or high salt concentrations. The severity of stress and the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction were highly correlated. These findings support the hypothesis that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism to increase survival in fluctuating environments and might function as a capacitor to promote evolvability.},

abstract = {We report a new type of interaction between two yeast prion proteins, Sup35 and New1. New1 consists of an N-terminal prion region (New1N) and a C-terminal region homologous to a translation elongation factor with two ATP-binding motifs. Amyloid formation of the Sup35 prion region (Sup35NM) was accelerated by a small amount of sonicated New1N amyloid (New1N-seeds) to produce Sup35NM[New1] amyloid. New1N amyloid formation was accelerated by Sup35NM[New1]-seeds but not by spontaneously generated Sup35NM-seeds, indicating that the structural features of the New1N amyloid were transmitted via the Sup35NM amyloid. Surprisingly, full-length New1 broke the Sup35NM amyloid fibrils in an ATP-dependent manner. This activity of New1 was independent from Hsp104. It was lost by a mutation in the second ATP-binding motif, by the truncation of the N-terminal prion region of New1 and by the pre-incubation of New1 with New1N-seeds. When New1 was overproduced in yeast [PSI(+)] cells carrying GFP-fused Sup35NM, diverse morphological changes in fluorescent foci occurred. Thus, New1 potentially has a regulatory role in prion state in yeast, working independently of the Hsp104 system.},

abstract = {We used tapping mode atomic force microscopy to study the morphology of the amyloid protofibrils formed at fixed conditions (low pH with high ionic strength) by self-assembly of the N-terminal domain of the hydrogenase maturation factor HypF. Although all protofibrils in the sample share a beaded structure and similar values of height and width, an accurate analysis of contour length and end-to-end distance and the comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions based on the worm-like chain model show that two different populations of protofibrils are present. These populations are characterized by different physical properties, such as persistence length, bending rigidity and Young's modulus. Fluorescence quenching measurements on earlier globular intermediates provide an independent evidence of the existence of different populations. The finding that differences in mechanical properties exist even within the same sample of protofibrils indicates the presence of different subpopulations of prefibrillar aggregates with potentially diverse tendencies to react with undesired molecular targets. This study describes a strategy to discriminate between such different subpopulations that are otherwise difficult to identify with conventional analyses.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) force spectroscopy is a technique with broad nanomedical applications, widely used for the characterization of molecular interactions on the nanoscale. Here we test this technique to evaluate compounds for influencing the protein aggregation process. The results demonstrate that Zn(2+) or Al(3+) cations bring about a dramatic increase of $\alpha$-synuclein interactions in unfavorable conditions for $\alpha$-synuclein misfolding (neutral pH). We did not observe the effect of dopamine at favorable conditions for $\alpha$-synuclein misfolding (acidic pH). We also found that electrostatic interactions do not play a significant role at acidic pH. These findings are generally in line with previous studies by various techniques. The high sensitivity of AFM force spectroscopy as well as its ability to test compounds for the same experimental system makes AFM an efficient nanotool for rapid analysis of compounds inhibiting early protein aggregation studies and quantitative selection of potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.

FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Atomic force microscopy is used to interrogate the influence of cations and $\alpha$-synuclein on the protein aggregation process. The report illustrates an application of AFM to unravel the potential of novel therapeutics on early protein aggregation intrinsic in neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Chen2010a,
abstract = {Soluble oligomers of Abeta42 peptide are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). It was recently found that at least some of the neurotoxic effects of these oligomers may be mediated by specific binding to the prion protein, PrP(C), on the cell surface (Laur{\'{e}}n, J., Gimbel, D. A., Nygaard, H. B., Gilbert, J. W., and Strittmatter, S. M. (2009) Nature 457, 1128-1132). Here we characterized the interaction between synthetic Abeta42 oligomers and the recombinant human prion protein (PrP) using two biophysical techniques: site-directed spin labeling and surface plasmon resonance. Our data indicate that this binding is highly specific for a particular conformation adopted by the peptide in soluble oligomeric species. The binding appears to be essentially identical for the Met(129) and Val(129) polymorphic forms of human PrP, suggesting that the role of PrP codon 129 polymorphism as a risk factor in AD is due to factors unrelated to the interaction with Abeta oligomers. It was also found that in addition to the previously identified approximately 95-110 segment, the second region of critical importance for the interaction with Abeta42 oligomers is a cluster of basic residues at the extreme N terminus of PrP (residues 23-27). The deletion of any of these segments results in a major loss of the binding function, indicating that these two regions likely act in concert to provide a high affinity binding site for Abeta42 oligomers. This insight may help explain the interplay between the postulated protective and pathogenic roles of PrP in AD and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies as well.},

abstract = {The capabilities of atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been rapidly expanding beyond topographical imaging to now allow for the analysis of a wide range of properties of diverse materials. The technique of nanoindentation, traditionally performed via dedicated indenters can now be reliably achieved using AFM instrumentation, enabling mechanical property determination at the nanoscale using the high spatial and force resolutions of the AFM. In the study of biological systems, from biomolecules to complexes, this technique provides insight into how mesoscale properties and functions may arise from a myriad of single biomolecules. In vivo and in situ analyses of native structures under physiological conditions as well as the rapid analysis of molecular species under a variety of experimental treatments are made possible with this technique. As a result, AFM nanoindentation has emerged as a critical tool for the study of biological systems in their natural state, further contributing to both biomaterial design and pharmacological research. In this review, we detail the theory and progression of AFM-based nanoindentation, and present several applications of this technique as it has been used to probe biomolecules and biological nanostructures from single proteins to complex assemblies. We further detail the many challenges associated with mechanical models and required assumptions for model validity. AFM nanoindentation capabilities have provided an excellent improvement over conventional nanomechanical tools and by integration of topographical data from imaging, enabled the rapid extraction and presentation of mechanical data for biological samples.},

abstract = {In addition to being associated with severe degenerative diseases, amyloids show exceptional mechanical properties including great strength, sturdiness and elasticity. However, thus far physical models that explain these properties remain elusive, and our understanding of molecular deformation and failure mechanisms of individual amyloid fibrils is limited. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics simulations, carried out to analyze the mechanical response of two-fold symmetric Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils, twisted protein nanofilaments consisting of a H-bonded layered structure. We find a correlation of the mechanical behavior with chemical and nanostructural rearrangements of the fibril during compressive and tensile deformation, showing that the density of H-bonds varies linearly with the measured strain. Further, we find that both compressive and tensile deformation is coupled with torsional deformation, which is manifested in a strong variation of the interlayer twist angle that is found to be proportional to both the applied stress and measured strain. In both compression and tension we observe an increase of the Young's modulus from 2.34 GPa (for less than 0.1{\%} strain in compression and 0.2{\%} strain in tension), to 12.43 GPa for compression and 18.05 GPa for tension. The moduli at larger deformation are in good agreement with experimental data, where values in the range of 10-20 GPa have been reported. Our studies confirm that amyloids feature a very high stiffness, and elucidate the importance of the chemical and structural rearrangements of the fibrils during deformation.},

abstract = {The initial concentration of monomeric amyloidogenic proteins is a crucial factor in the in vitro formation of amyloid fibrils. We use quantitative atomic force microscopy to study the effect of the initial concentration of human alpha-synuclein on the mean length of mature alpha-synuclein fibrils, which are associated with Parkinson's disease. We determine that the critical initial concentration, below which low-molecular-weight species dominate and above which fibrils are the dominant species, lies at approximately 15 muM, in good agreement with earlier measurements using biochemical methods. In the concentration regime where fibrils dominate, we find that their mean length increases with initial concentration. These results correspond well to the qualitative predictions of a recent statistical-mechanical model of amyloid fibril formation. In addition, good quantitative agreement of the statistical-mechanical model with the measured mean fibril length as a function of initial protein concentration, as well as with the fibril length distributions for several protein concentrations, is found for reasonable values of the relevant model parameters. The comparison between theory and experiment yields, for the first time to our knowledge, an estimate of the magnitude of the free energies associated with the intermolecular interactions that govern alpha-synuclein fibril formation.},

This is due to the nature of the process, which may be described as a dynamically evolving equilibrium between a large number of structural species. These are furthermore of highly diverging sizes and present in very uneven amounts and timeframes. Different structural methods have different strengths and limitations. These, and in particular recent advances within solution analysis of the undisturbed equilibrium using small angle X-ray scattering, are reviewed here.},

A variety of AFM force spectroscopy approaches have been developed for investigating native cell surfaces with piconewton (nanonewton) sensitivity and nanometer lateral resolution, providing novel information on the nanomechanical properties of cell walls, on surface forces such as van der Waals and electrostatic forces, solvation and steric/bridging forces, and on the forces and localization of molecular recognition events. The intention of this article is to survey these different applications and to discuss related methodologies (how to prepare tips and samples, how to record and interpret force curves).},

abstract = {Glucagon solutions at pH 2.0 were subjected to mechanical agitation at 37 degrees C in the presence of a hydrophobic surface to explore the details of aggregation and fiber formation. High-resolution intermittent-contact atomic force microscopy performed in solution revealed the presence of aggregates after 0.5 h; however, longer agitation times resulted in the formation of fibrillated structures with varying levels of higher-order assembly. Height, periodicity, and amplitude measurements of these structures allowed the identification of four distinct fiber types. The most elementary fiber form, designated a filament, self-associates in a specific wound fashion to produce protofibrils composed of two filaments. Subsequent self-assembly of these filaments and protofibrils leads to two well-defined fibrillar motifs, termed Type I and Type II. Atomic force microscopy imaging of pH 2.8 glucagon solutions not agitated or exposed to elevated temperature revealed the presence of amorphous aggregates before the formation of fibrillar structures similar to those seen at pH 2.0. Time-course solution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thioflavin T binding studies suggested that glucagon aggregation and fibril formation were associated with the development of beta-sheet structure. The results of these studies are used to describe a possible mechanism for glucagon aggregation and fibrillation that is consistent with a hierarchical assembly model proposed for amyloid fibril formation.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils were produced from the full-length mouse prion protein (PrP) under solvent conditions similar to those used for the generation of synthetic prions from PrP 89-230. Analysis of the ultrastructure by atomic force microscopy revealed extremely broad polymorphism in fibrils formed under a single growth condition. Fibrils varied with respect to the number of constitutive filaments and the manner in which the filaments were assembled. PrP polymerization was found to show several peculiar features: (i) the higher-order fibrils/ribbons were formed through a highly hierarchical mechanism of assembly of lower-order fibrils/ribbons; (ii) the lateral assembly proceeded stepwise; at each step, a semi-stable fibrillar species were generated, which were then able to enter the next level of assembly; (iii) the assembly of lower into higher-order fibrils occurred predominantly in a vertical dimension via stacking of ribbons on top of each other; (iv) alternative modes of lateral association co-existed under a single growth condition; (iv) the fibrillar morphology changed even within individual fibrils, illustrating that alternative modes of filament assembly are inter-convertible and thermodynamically equivalent. The most predominant fibrillar types were classified into five groups according to their height, each of which was divided in up to three subgroups according to their width. Detailed analysis of ultrastructure revealed that the fibrils of the major subtype (height 3.61(+/-0.28)nm, width 31.1(+/-2.0)nm) were composed of two ribbons, each of which was composed of two filaments. The molecular volume calculations indicated that a single PrP molecule occupied a distance of approximately 1.2 nm within a single filament. High polymorphism in fibrils generated in vitro is reminiscent of high morphological diversity of scrapie-associated fibrils isolated from scrapie brains, suggesting that polymorphism is peculiar for polymerization of PrP regardless of whether fibrils are formed in vitro or under pathological conditions in vivo.},

To demonstrate its application we first duplicated the promoter of the FAR1 gene in yeast and simultaneously inserted a GFP downstream of it. This created a reporter for promoter activity while leaving the FAR1 gene fully intact. In another experiment, we used PCR duplication to increase the dosage of a gene in a discrete manner, from 1× to 2x. Using TUB4, the gene encoding for the yeast $\gamma$-tubulin, we validated that this led to corresponding increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. PCR duplication is an easy one-step procedure that can be adapted in different ways to permit rapid, disturbance-free investigation of various genomic regulatory elements without the need for ex vivo cloning.},

abstract = {The sharing of secreted invertase by yeast cells is a well-established laboratory model for cooperation, but the only evidence that such cooperation occurs in nature is that the SUC loci, which encode invertase, vary in number and functionality. Genotypes that do not produce invertase can act as 'cheats' in laboratory experiments, growing on the glucose that is released when invertase producers, or 'cooperators', digest sucrose. However, genetic variation for invertase production might instead be explained by adaptation of different populations to different local availabilities of sucrose, the substrate for invertase. Here we find that 110 wild yeast strains isolated from natural habitats, and all contained a single SUC locus and produced invertase; none were 'cheats'. The only genetic variants we found were three strains isolated instead from sucrose-rich nectar, which produced higher levels of invertase from three additional SUC loci at their subtelomeres. We argue that the pattern of SUC gene variation is better explained by local adaptation than by social conflict.},

abstract = {Typical amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's were thought to exclusively result from de novo aggregation, but recently it was shown that amyloids formed in one cell can cross-seed aggregation in other cells, following a prion-like mechanism. Despite the large experimental effort devoted to understanding the phenomenon of prion transmissibility, it is still poorly understood how this property is encoded in the primary sequence. In many cases, prion structural conversion is driven by the presence of relatively large glutamine/asparagine (Q/N) enriched segments. Several studies suggest that it is the amino acid composition of these regions rather than their specific sequence that accounts for their priogenicity. However, our analysis indicates that it is instead the presence and potency of specific short amyloid-prone sequences that occur within intrinsically disordered Q/N-rich regions that determine their prion behaviour, modulated by the structural and compositional context. This provides a basis for the accurate identification and evaluation of prion candidate sequences in proteomes in the context of a unified framework for amyloid formation and prion propagation.},

abstract = {Epigenetics studies the emergence of different phenotypes from a single genotype. Although these processes are essential to cellular differentiation and transcriptional memory, they are also widely used in all branches of the tree of life by organisms that require plastic but stable adaptation to their physical and social environment. Because of the inherent flexibility of epigenetic regulation, a variety of biological phenomena can be traced back to evolutionary adaptations of few conserved molecular pathways that converge on chromatin. For these reasons chromatin biology and epigenetic research have a rich history of chasing discoveries in a variety of model organisms, including yeast, flies, plants and humans. Many more fascinating examples of epigenetic plasticity lie outside the realm of model organisms and have so far been only sporadically investigated at a molecular level; however, recent progress on sequencing technology and genome editing tools have begun to blur the lines between model and non-model organisms, opening numerous new avenues for investigation. Here, I review examples of epigenetic phenomena in non-model organisms that have emerged as potential experimental systems, including social insects, fish and flatworms, and are becoming accessible to molecular approaches.},

abstract = {Prions are self-perpetuating conformational variants of particular proteins. In yeast, prions cause heritable phenotypic traits. Most known yeast prions contain a glutamine (Q)/asparagine (N)-rich region in their prion domains. [PSI+], the prion form of Sup35, appears de novo at dramatically enhanced rates following transient overproduction of Sup35 in the presence of [PIN+], the prion form of Rnq1. Here, we establish the temporal de novo appearance of Sup35 aggregates during such overexpression in relation to other cellular proteins. Fluorescently-labeled Sup35 initially forms one or a few dots when overexpressed in [PIN+] cells. One of the dots is perivacuolar, colocalizes with the aggregated Rnq1 dot and grows into peripheral rings/lines, some of which also colocalize with Rnq1. Sup35 dots that are not near the vacuole do not always colocalize with Rnq1 and disappear by the time rings start to grow. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation failed to detect any interaction between Sup35-VN and Rnq1-VC in [PSI+][PIN+] cells. In contrast, all Sup35 aggregates, whether newly induced or in established [PSI+], completely colocalize with the molecular chaperones Hsp104, Sis1, Ssa1 and eukaryotic release factor Sup45. In the absence of [PIN+], overexpressed aggregating proteins such as the Q/N-rich Pin4C or the non-Q/N-rich Mod5 can also promote the de novo appearance of [PSI+]. Similar to Rnq1, overexpressed Pin4C transiently colocalizes with newly appearing Sup35 aggregates. However, no interaction was detected between Mod5 and Sup35 during [PSI+] induction in the absence of [PIN+]. While the colocalization of Sup35 and aggregates of Rnq1 or Pin4C are consistent with the model that the heterologous aggregates cross-seed the de novo appearance of [PSI+], the lack of interaction between Mod5 and Sup35 leaves open the possibility of other mechanisms. We also show that Hsp104 is required in the de novo appearance of [PSI+] aggregates in a [PIN+]-independent pathway.},

abstract = {The [URE3] prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a self-propagating inactive amyloid form of the Ure2 protein. Ure2p residues 1-65 constitute the prion domain, and the remaining C-terminal portion regulates nitrogen catabolism. We have examined the URE2 genes of wild-type isolates of S. cerevisiae and those of several pathogenic yeasts and a filamentous fungus. We find that the normal function of the S. cerevisiae Ure2p in nitrogen regulation is fully complemented by the Ure2p of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida kefyr, Candida maltosa, Saccharomyces bayanus, and Saccharomyces paradoxus, all of which have high homology in the C-terminal nitrogen regulation domain. However, there is considerable divergence of their N-terminal domains from that of Ure2p of S. cerevisiae. [URE3(Sc)] showed efficient transmission into S. cerevisiae ure2Delta cells if expressing a Ure2p of species within Saccharomyces. However, [URE3(Sc)] did not seed self-propagating inactivation of the Ure2p's from the other yeasts. When overexpressed as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, residues 5-47 of the S. cerevisiae prion domain are necessary for curing the [URE3] prion. Residues 11-39 are necessary for an inactivating interaction with the full-length Ure2p. A nearly identical region is highly conserved among many of the yeasts examined in this study, despite the wide divergence of sequences found in other parts of the N-terminal domains.},

abstract = {Prions are "infectious" proteins. When Sup35, a yeast translation termination factor, is aggregated in its [PSI(+)] prion form its function is compromised. When Rnq1 is aggregated in its [PIN(+)] prion form, it promotes the de novo appearance of [PSI(+)]. Heritable variants (strains) of [PSI(+)] with distinct phenotypes have been isolated and are analogous to mammalian prion strains with different pathologies. Here, we describe heritable variants of the [PIN(+)] prion that are distinguished by the efficiency with which they enhance the de novo appearance of [PSI(+)]. Unlike [PSI(+)] variants, where the strength of translation termination corresponds to the level of soluble Sup35, the phenotypes of these [PIN(+)] variants do not correspond to levels of soluble Rnq1. However, diploids and meiotic progeny from crosses between either different [PSI(+)], or different [PIN(+)] variants, always have the phenotype of the parental variant with the least soluble Sup35 or Rnq1, respectively. Apparently faster growing prion variants cure cells of slower growing or less stable variants of the same prion. We also find that YDJ1 overexpression eliminates some but not other [PIN(+)] variants and that prions are destabilized by meiosis. Finally, we show that, like its affect on [PSI(+)] appearance, [PIN(+)] enhances the de novo appearance of [URE3]. Surprisingly, [PSI(+)] inhibited [URE3] appearance. These results reinforce earlier reports that heterologous prions interact, but suggest that such interactions can not only positively, but also negatively, influence the de novo generation of prions.},

abstract = {The [URE3] yeast prion is a self-propagating inactive form of the Ure2 protein. Ure2p is composed of two domains, residues 1-93, the prion-forming domain, and the remaining C-terminal part of the protein, which forms the functional domain involved in nitrogen catabolite repression. In vitro, Ure2p forms amyloid filaments that have been proposed to be the aggregated prion form found in vivo. Here we showed that the biochemical characteristics of these two species differ. Protease digestions of Ure2p filaments and soluble Ure2p are comparable when analyzed by Coomassie staining as by Western blot. However, this finding does not explain the pattern specifically observed in [URE3] strains. Antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of Ure2p revealed the existence of proteolysis sites efficiently cleaved when [URE3], but not wild-type crude extracts, were submitted to limited proteolysis. The same antibodies lead to an equivalent digestion pattern when recombinant Ure2p (either soluble or amyloid) was analyzed in the same way. These results strongly suggest that aggregated Ure2p in [URE3] yeast cells is different from the amyloid filaments generated in vitro.},

Deletions in the C-terminal nitrogen regulation domain of Ure2p increase the frequency with which the N-terminal prion domain polymerizes into the prion form, suggesting that the C-terminus stabilizes the prion domain or that the structured C-terminal region sterically impairs amyloid formation. We find by in vivo two-hybrid analysis no evidence of interaction of prion domain and C-terminal domain. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance spectrometry shows no evidence of interaction of prion domain and C-terminal domain, and cleavage at a specific site between the domains frees the two fragments. Our NMR analysis indicates that most residues of the prion domain are in fact disordered in the soluble form of Ure2p. Deleting the tether holding the C-terminal structured region to the amyloid core does not impair prion formation, arguing against steric impairment of amyloid formation. These results suggest that the N-terminal prion domain is unstructured in the soluble protein and does not have a specific interaction with the C-terminus.},

According to the "amyloid backbone" model, the N-terminal asparagine-rich domains of Ure2p polymerize to form an amyloid core fibril that is surrounded by C-terminal domains in their native conformation. Protease resistance and Congo Red binding as well as beta-sheet content detected by spectroscopy-all markers for amyloid-have supported this model, as has the close resemblance between 40 A N-domain fibrils and the fibrillar core of intact Ure2p filaments visualized by cryo-electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we present electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction data from filaments of Ure2p, of N-domains alone, of fragments thereof, and of an N-domain-containing fusion protein that demonstrate in each case the 4.7A reflection that is typical for cross-beta structure and highly indicative of amyloid. This reflection was observed for specimens prepared by air-drying with and without sucrose embedding. To confirm that the corresponding structure is not an artifact of air-drying, the reflection was also demonstrated for specimens preserved in vitreous ice. Local area electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction from partially aligned specimens showed that the 4.7A reflection is meridional and therefore the underlying structure is cross-beta.},

We found that [URE3] is conserved in S. uvarum. In contrast, [URE3] was not detected in S. paradoxus. The inability of S. paradoxus Ure2p to switch to a prion isoform results from the primary sequence of the protein and not from the lack of cellular cofactors as heterologous Ure2p can propagate [URE3] in this species. Our data therefore demonstrate that [URE3] is conserved only in a subset of Saccharomyces species.

This ability to take up ureidosuccinate has been commonly used to assay for the presence of [URE3]. However, this assay has a number of practical limitations, affecting the range of experiments that can be performed with [URE3]. Here, we describe recently developed alternative selection methods for the presence or absence of [URE3]. They make use of the Ure2p-regulated DAL5 promoter in conjunction with ADE2, URA3, kanMX, and CAN1 reporter genes, and allow for higher stringency in selection both for and against [URE3], nonselective assay of prion variants, and direct transformation of prion filaments.

abstract = {The [URE3] prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares many features with mammalian prions and poly-glutamine related disorders and has become a model for studying amyloid diseases. The development of the [URE3] phenotype is thought to be caused by a structural switch in the Ure2p protein. In [URE3] cells, Ure2p is found predominantly in an aggregated state, while it is a soluble dimer in wild-type cells. In vitro, Ure2p forms fibrils with amyloid-like properties. Several studies suggest that the N-terminal domain of Ure2p is essential for prion formation. In this work, we investigated the fibril formation of Ure2p by isolating soluble oligomeric species, which are generated during fibrillization, and characterized them with respect to size and structure. Our data support the critical role of the N-terminal domain for fibril formation, as we observed fibrils in the presence of 5 M guanidinium chloride, conditions at which the C-terminal domain is completely unfolded. Based on fluorescence measurements, we conclude that the structure of the C-terminal domain is very similar in dimeric and fibrillar Ure2p. When studying the time course of fibrillization, we detected the formation of small, soluble oligomeric species during the early stages of the process. Their remarkable resistance against denaturants, their increased content of beta-structure, and their ability to 'seed' Ure2p fibrillization suggest that conversion to the amyloid-like conformation has already occurred. Thus, they likely represent critical intermediates in the fibrillization pathway of Ure2p.},

abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains in its proteome at least three prion proteins. These proteins (Ure2p, Sup35p, and Rnq1p) share a set of remarkable properties. In vivo, they form aggregates that self-perpetuate their aggregation. This aggregation is controlled by Hsp104, which plays a major role in the growth and severing of these prions. In vitro, these prion proteins form amyloid fibrils spontaneously. The introduction of such fibrils made from Ure2p or Sup35p into yeast cells leads to the prion phenotypes [URE3] and [PSI], respectively. Previous studies on evolutionary biology of yeast prions have clearly established that [URE3] is not well conserved in the hemiascomycetous yeasts and particularly in S. paradoxus. Here we demonstrated that the S. paradoxus Ure2p is able to form infectious amyloid. These fibrils are more resistant than S. cerevisiae Ure2p fibrils to shear force. The observation, in vivo, of a distinct aggregation pattern for GFP fusions confirms the higher propensity of SpUre2p to form fibrillar structures. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis of aggregation propensity of the S. paradoxus Ure2p provides an explanation for its loss of infective properties and suggests that this protein belongs to the non-prion amyloid world.},

abstract = {As hamster scrapie cannot infect mice, due to sequence differences in their PrP proteins, we find "species barriers" to transmission of the [URE3] prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae among Ure2 proteins of S. cerevisiae, paradoxus, bayanus, cariocanus, and mikatae on the basis of differences among their Ure2p prion domain sequences. The rapid variation of the N-terminal Ure2p prion domains results in protection against the detrimental effects of infection by a prion, just as the PrP residue 129 Met/Val polymorphism may have arisen to protect humans from the effects of cannibalism. Just as spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy prion variant is less impaired by species barriers than is sheep scrapie, we find that some [URE3] prion variants are infectious to another yeast species while other variants (with the identical amino acid sequence) are not. The species barrier is thus prion variant dependent as in mammals. [URE3] prion variant characteristics are maintained even on passage through the Ure2p of another species. Ure2p of Saccharomyces castelli has an N-terminal Q/N-rich "prion domain" but does not form prions (in S. cerevisiae) and is not infected with [URE3] from Ure2p of other Saccharomyces. This implies that conservation of its prion domain is not for the purpose of forming prions.

abstract = {The genetic properties of the non-Mendelian element, [URE3], suggest that it is a prion (infectious protein) form of Ure2p, a mediator of nitrogen regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Into a ure2{\{}Delta{\}} strain (necessarily lacking [URE3]), we introduced a plasmid overproducing Ure2p. This induced the frequent "spontaneous generation" of [URE3], with properties identical to the original [URE3]. Altering the translational frame only in the prion-inducing domain of URE2 shows that it is Ure2 protein (and not URE2 RNA) that induces appearance of [URE3]. The proteinase K-resistance of Ure2p is unique to [URE3] strains and is not seen in nitrogen regulation of normal strains. The prion-inducing domain of Ure2p (residues 1-65) can propagate [URE3] in the absence of the C-terminal part of the molecule. In contrast, the C-terminal part of Ure2p cannot be converted to the prion (inactive) form without the prion-inducing domain covalently attached. These experiments support the prion model for [URE3] and extend our understanding of its propagation.},

abstract = {The [URE3] yeast prion is a self-propagating inactive form of the Ure2p protein. We show here that Ure2p from the species Saccharomyces paradoxus (Ure2p(Sp)) can be efficiently converted into a prion form and propagate [URE3] when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at physiological level. We found however that Ure2p(Sp) overexpression prevents efficient prion propagation. We have compared the aggregation rate and propagon numbers of Ure2p(Sp) and of S. cerevisiae Ure2p (Ure2p(Sc)) in [URE3] cells both at different expression levels. Overexpression of both Ure2p orthologues accelerates formation of large aggregates but Ure2p(Sp) aggregates faster than Ure2p(Sc). Although the yeast cells that contain these large Ure2p aggregates do not transmit [URE3] to daughter cells, the corresponding crude extract retains the ability to induce [URE3] in wild-type [ure3-0] cells. At low expression level, propagon numbers are higher with Ure2p(Sc) than with Ure2p(Sp). Overexpression of Ure2p decreases the number of [URE3] propagons with Ure2p(Sc). Together, our results demonstrate that the concentration of a prion protein is a key factor for prion propagation. We propose a model to explain how prion protein overexpression can produce a detrimental effect on prion propagation and why Ure2p(Sp) might be more sensitive to such effects than Ure2p(Sc).},

abstract = {Ure2p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally functions in blocking utilization of a poor nitrogen source when a good nitrogen source is available. The non-Mendelian genetic element [URE3] is a prion (infectious protein) form of Ure2p, so that overexpression of Ure2p induces the de novo appearance of infectious [URE3]. Earlier studies defined a prion domain comprising Ure2p residues 1 to 64 and a nitrogen regulation domain included in residues 66 to 354. We find that deletion of individual runs of asparagine within the prion domain reduce prion-inducing activity. Although residues 1 to 64 are sufficient for prion induction, the fragment from residues 1 to 80 is a more efficient inducer of [URE3]. In-frame deletion of a region around residue 224 does not affect nitrogen regulation but does eliminate prion induction by the remainder of Ure2p. Larger deletions removing the region around residue 224 and more of the C-terminal part of Ure2p restore prion-inducing ability. A fragment of Ure2p lacking the original prion domain does not induce [URE3], but surprisingly, further deletion of residues 151 to 157 and 348 to 354 leaves a fragment that can do so. The region from 66 to 80 and the region around residue 224 are both necessary for this second prion-inducing activity. Thus, each of two nonoverlapping parts of Ure2p is sufficient to induce the appearance of the [URE3] prion.

abstract = {An important function of the RTG signaling pathway is maintenance of intracellular glutamate supplies in yeast cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Herein, we report that MKS1 is a negative regulator of the RTG pathway, acting between Rtg2p, a proximal sensor of mitochondrial function, and the bHLH transcription factors Rtg1p and Rtg3p. In mks1[Delta] cells, RTG target gene expression is constitutive, bypassing the requirement for Rtg2p, and is no longer repressible by glutamate. We show further that Mks1p is a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation pattern parallels that of Rtg3p in response to activation of the RTG pathway, and that Mks1p is in a complex with Rtg2p. MKS1 was previously implicated in the formation of [URE3], an inactive prion form of a negative regulator of the nitrogen catabolite repression pathway, Ure2p. rtg[Delta] mutations induce [URE3] and can do so independently of MKS1. We find that glutamate suppresses [URE3] formation, suggesting that the Mks1p effect on the formation of [URE3] can occur indirectly via regulation of the RTG pathway.},

abstract = {The yeast inheritable phenotype [URE3] is thought to result from conformational changes in the normally soluble and highly helical protein Ure2p. In vitro, the protein spontaneously forms long, straight, insoluble protein fibrils at neutral pH. Here we show that fibrils of intact Ure2p assembled in vitro do not possess the cross beta-structure of amyloid, but instead are formed by the polymerization of native-like helical subunits that retain the ability to bind substrate analogues. We further show that dissociation of the normally dimeric protein to its constituent monomers is a prerequisite for assembly into fibrils. By analysing the nature of early assembly intermediates, as well as fully assembled Ure2p fibrils using atomic force microscopy, and combining the results with experiments that probe the fidelity of the native fold in protein fibrils, we present a model for fibril formation, based on assembly of native-like monomers, driven by interactions between the N-terminal glutamine and asparagine-rich region and the C-terminal functional domain. The results provide a rationale for the effect of mutagenesis on prion formation and new insights into the mechanism by which this, and possibly other inheritable factors, can be propagated.},

We show here by in silico analysis that the GST-like functional domain and the prion domain of the Ure2 proteins have diverged separately, the functional domain being more conserved through the evolution. The more extreme situation is found in the two S. pombe genes, in which the prion domain is absent. The functional analysis demonstrates that all the homologous genes except for the two S. pombe genes are able to complement the URE2 gene deletion in a S. cerevisiae strain. We show that in the two most closely related yeast species to S. cerevisiae, i.e., S. paradoxus and S. uvarum, the prion domains of the proteins have retained the capability to induce [URE3] in a S. cerevisiae strain. However, only the S. uvarum full-length Ure2p is able to behave as a prion.

Extracts of [URE3] strains, as well as amyloid of Ure2p formed in an extract-primed reaction could transmit to uninfected cells the [URE3] variant present in the cells from which the extracts were made. Infectivity and determinant of [URE3] variants resided within the N-terminal 65 amino acids of Ure2p. Notably, we could show that amyloid filaments of recombinant Ure2p are nearly as infectious per mass of Ure2p as extracts of [URE3] strains. Sizing experiments indicated that infectious particles in vitro and in vivo were >20 nm in diameter, suggesting that they were amyloid filaments and not smaller oligomeric structures.

The [URE3] and [PSI+] prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are infectious amyloid forms of the proteins Ure2p and Sup35p, respectively. Ure2p forms prions primarily as a result of its sequence composition, as versions of Ure2p with the prion domain amino acids shuffled are still able to form prions. Here we show that prion induction by both Ure2p and Ure2-21p, one of the scrambled versions of Ure2p, is clearly dependent on the length of the inducing fragment. For Ure2-21p, no single sequence is found in all of the inducing fragments, highlighting the sequence independence of prion formation. Furthermore, the sequence of the Sup35p prion domain can also be randomized without blocking prion formation. Indeed, a single shuffled sequence could give rise to several prion variants. These results suggest that [PSI+] formation is driven primarily by the amino acid composition of the Sup35p prion domain, and that the Sup35p oligopeptide repeats are not required for prion maintenance.},

We previously reported that mks1Delta prevents generation of [URE3] and others reported that glutamate in the medium or the elevated glutamate in mks1Delta strains blocks [URE3] generation. We show here that elevated glutamate does not block [URE3] generation, but that neither does mks1Delta. Rather, a post-transcriptional effect on DAL5 of mks1Delta through the retrograde regulation pathway prevents detection of [URE3] prion-containing colonies. Moreover, the presence of both ammonia and glutamate blocks USA uptake in a known [URE3] strain, so that detection of the prion is prevented, rather than its generation.},

abstract = {The Ure2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can become a prion (infectious protein). At very low frequencies Ure2p forms an insoluble, infectious amyloid known as [URE3], which is efficiently transmitted to progeny cells or mating partners that consequently lose the normal Ure2p nitrogen regulatory function. The [URE3] prion causes yeast cells to grow slowly, has never been identified in the wild, and confers no obvious phenotypic advantage. An N-terminal asparagine-rich domain determines Ure2p prion-forming ability. Since ure2Delta strains are complemented by plasmids that overexpress truncated forms of Ure2p lacking the prion domain, the existence of the [URE3] prion and the evolutionary conservation of an N-terminal extension have remained mysteries. We find that Ure2p function is actually compromised in vivo by truncation of the prion domain. Moreover, Ure2p stability is diminished without the full-length prion domain. Mca1p, like Ure2p, has an N-terminal Q/N-rich domain whose deletion reduces its steady-state levels. Finally, we demonstrate that the prion domain may affect the interaction of Ure2p with other components of the nitrogen regulation system, specifically the negative regulator of nitrogen catabolic genes, Gzf3p.},

We find that double deletion of BTN2 and CUR1 stabilizes [URE3] against curing by several agents, produces a remarkable increase in the proportion of strong [URE3] variants arising de novo and an increase in the number of [URE3] prion seeds. Thus, normal levels of Btn2p and Cur1p affect prion generation and propagation. Btn2p-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins appear as a single dot located close to the nucleus and the vacuole. During the curing process, those cells having both Ure2p-GFP aggregates and Btn2p-RFP dots display striking colocalization. Btn2p curing requires cell division, and our results suggest that Btn2p is part of a system, reminiscent of the mammalian aggresome, that collects aggregates preventing their efficient distribution to progeny cells.},

abstract = {Ure2 is the protein determinant of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion [URE3]. Ure2 has structural similarity to glutathione transferases, protects cells against heavy metal and oxidant toxicity in vivo, and shows glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity in vitro. Here we report that Ure2 (which has no cysteine residues) also shows thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity similar to that of glutaredoxin enzymes. This demonstrates that disulfide reductase activity can be independent of the classical glutaredoxin CXXC/CXXS motif or indeed an intrinsic catalytic cysteine residue. The kinetics of the glutaredoxin activity of Ure2 showed positive cooperativity for the substrate glutathione in both the soluble native state and in amyloid-like fibrils, indicating native-like dimeric structure within Ure2 fibrils. Characterization of the glutaredoxin activity of Ure2 sheds light on its ability to protect yeast from heavy metal ion and oxidant toxicity and suggests a role in reversible protein glutathionylation signal transduction. Observation of allosteric enzyme behavior within amyloid-like Ure2 fibrils not only provides insight into the molecular structure of the fibrils but also has implications for the mechanism of [URE3] prion formation.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases in humans, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases. In yeast, amyloid underlies several non-Mendelian phenotypes referred to as yeast prions. Mechanism of amyloid formation is critical for a complete understanding of the yeast prion phenomenon and human amyloid-related diseases. Ure2 protein is the basis of yeast prion [URE3]. The Ure2p prion domain is largely disordered. Residual structures, if any, in the disordered region may play an important role in the aggregation process. Studies of Ure2p prion domain are complicated by its high aggregation propensity, which results in a mixture of monomer and aggregates in solution. Previously we have developed a solid-support electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) approach to address this problem and have identified a structured state for the Alzheimer's amyloid-$\beta$ monomer. Here we use solid-support EPR to study the structure of Ure2p prion domain. EPR spectra of Ure2p prion domain with spin labels at every fifth residue from position 10 to position 75 show similar residue mobility profile for denaturing and native buffers after accounting for the effect of solution viscosity. These results suggest that Ure2p prion domain adopts a completely disordered structure in the native buffer. A completely disordered Ure2p prion domain implies that the amyloid formation of Ure2p, and likely other Q/N-rich yeast prion proteins, is primarily driven by inter-molecular interactions.},

Using S. cerevisiae as a test bed, we previously showed that Ure2p of Candida albicans (CaUre2p) can also form a prion, but that Ure2p of C. glabrata (CgUre2p) cannot. Here, we constructed C. glabrata strains to test whether CgUre2p can form a prion in its native environment. We find that while CaUre2p can form a [URE3] in C. glabrata, CgUre2p cannot, although the latter has a prion domain sequence more similar to that of ScUre2p than that of CaUre2p. This supports the notion that prion formation is not a conserved property of Ure2p but is a pathology arising sporadically. We find that some [URE3albicans] variants are restricted in their transmissibility to certain recipient strains. In addition, we show that the C. glabrata HO can induce switching of the C. glabrata mating type locus.},

abstract = {The Ure2 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proposed to undergo a prion-like autocatalytic conformational change, which leads to inactivation of the protein, thereby generating the [URE3] phenotype. The first 65 amino acids, which are dispensable for the cellular function of Ure2p in nitrogen metabolism, are necessary and sufficient for [URE3] (Masison {\&} Wickner, 1995), leading to designation of this domain as the Ure2 prion domain (UPD). We expressed both UPD and Ure2 as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and observed both to be initially soluble. Upon cleavage of GST-UPD by thrombin, the released UPD formed ordered fibrils that displayed amyloid-like characteristics, such as Congo red dye binding and green-gold birefringence. The fibrils exhibited high beta-sheet content by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fiber formation proceeded in an autocatalytic manner. In contrast, the released, full-length Ure2p formed mostly amorphous aggregates; a small amount polymerized into fibrils of uniform size and morphology. Aggregation of Ure2p could be seeded by UPD fibrils. Our results provide biochemical support for the proposal that the [URE3] state is caused by a self-propagating inactive form of Ure2p. We also found that the uncleaved GST-UPD fusion protein could polymerize into amyloid fibrils by a strictly autocatalytic mechanism, forcing the GST moiety of the protein to adopt a new, beta-sheet-rich conformation. The findings on the GST-UPD fusion protein indicate that the ability of the prion domain to mediate a prion-like conversion process is not specific for or limited to the Ure2p.},

De novo prion generation is believed responsible for most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and for initiating the mad cow disease epidemic. However, the cellular components needed for prion generation have not been identified in any system. The [URE3] prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an infectious form of Ure2p, apparently a self-propagating amyloid. We now demonstrate a protein required for de novo prion generation. Mks1p negatively regulates Ure2p and is itself negatively regulated by the presence of ammonia and by the Ras-cAMP pathway. We find that in mks1Delta strains, de novo generation of the [URE3] prion is blocked, although [URE3] introduced from another strain is expressed and propagates stably. Ras2(Val19) increases cAMP production and also blocks [URE3] generation. These results emphasize the distinction between prion generation and propagation, and they show that cellular regulatory mechanisms can critically affect prion generation.},

Here we show by electron microscopy that [URE3] cells overexpressing Ure2p contain distinctive, filamentous networks in their cytoplasm, and demonstrate by immunolabeling that these networks contain Ure2p. In contrast, overexpressing wild-type cells show a variety of Ure2p distributions: usually, the protein is dispersed sparsely throughout the cytoplasm, although occasionally it is found in multiple small, focal aggregates. However, these distributions do not resemble the single, large networks seen in [URE3] cells, nor do the control cells exhibit cytoplasmic filaments. In [URE3] cell extracts, Ure2p is present in aggregates that are only partially solubilized by boiling in SDS and urea. In these aggregates, the NH2-terminal prion domain is inaccessible to antibodies, whereas the COOH-terminal nitrogen regulation domain is accessible. This finding is consistent with the proposal that the prion domains stack to form the filament backbone, which is surrounded by the COOH-terminal domains.

The presence of [URE3] allows yeast cells to take up ureidosuccinic acid in the presence of ammonia. This phenotype can be used to select for the prion state. We have developed a novel reporter, in which the ADE2 gene is controlled by the DAL5 regulatory region, which allows monitoring of Ure2p function by a colony color phenotype. Using this reporter, we observed induction of different [URE3] prion variants ("strains") following overexpression of the N-terminal Ure2p prion domain (UPD) or full-length Ure2p. Full-length Ure2p induced two types of [URE3]: type A corresponds to conventional [URE3], whereas the novel type B variant is characterized by relatively high residual Ure2p activity and efficient curing by coexpression of low amounts of a UPD-green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Overexpression of UPD induced type B [URE3] but not type A. Both type A and B [URE3] strains, as well as weak and strong isolates of type A, were shown to stably maintain different prion strain characteristics. We suggest that these strain variants result from different modes of aggregation of similar Ure2p monomers. We also demonstrate a procedure to counterselect against the [URE3] state.},

abstract = {The [URE3] and [PSI(+)] prions are the infections amyloid forms of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Ure2p and Sup35p, respectively. Randomizing the order of the amino acids in the Ure2 and Sup35 prion domains while retaining amino acid composition does not block prion formation, indicating that amino acid composition, not primary sequence, is the predominant feature driving [URE3] and [PSI(+)] formation. Here we show that Ure2p promiscuously interacts with various compositionally similar proteins to influence [URE3] levels. Overexpression of scrambled Ure2p prion domains efficiently increases de novo formation of wild-type [URE3] in vivo. In vitro, amyloid aggregates of the scrambled prion domains efficiently seed wild-type Ure2p amyloid formation, suggesting that the wild-type and scrambled prion domains can directly interact to seed prion formation. To test whether interactions between Ure2p and naturally occurring yeast proteins could similarly affect [URE3] formation, we identified yeast proteins with domains that are compositionally similar to the Ure2p prion domain. Remarkably, all but one of these domains were also able to efficiently increase [URE3] formation. These results suggest that a wide variety of proteins could potentially affect [URE3] formation.},

abstract = {The yeast non-Mendelian factor [URE3] propagates by a prion-like mechanism, involving aggregation of the chromosomally encoded protein Ure2. The [URE3] phenotype is equivalent to loss of function of Ure2, a protein involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism. The prion-like behaviour of Ure2 in vivo is dependent on the first 65 amino acid residues of its N-terminal region which contains a highly repetitive sequence rich in asparagine. This region has been termed the prion-determining domain (PrD). Removal of as little as residues 2-20 of the protein is sufficient to prevent occurrence of the [URE3] phenotype. Removal of the PrD does not affect the regulatory activity of Ure2. The C-terminal portion of the protein has homology to glutathione S -transferases, which are dimeric proteins. We have produced the Ure2 protein to high yield in Escherichia coli from a synthetic gene. The recombinant purified protein is shown to be a dimer. The stability, folding and oligomeric state of Ure2 and a series of N-terminally truncated or deleted variants were studied and compared. The stability of Ure2, DeltaGD-N, H2O, determined by chemical denaturation and monitored by fluorescence, is 12.1(+/-0.4) kcal mol-1at 25 degrees C and pH 8.4. A range of structural probes show a single, coincident unfolding transition, which is invariant over a 550-fold change in protein concentration. The stability is the same within error for Ure2 variants lacking all or part of the prion-determining domain. The data indicate that in the folded protein the PrD is in an unstructured conformation and does not form specific intra- or intermolecular interactions at micromolar protein concentrations. This suggests that the C-terminal domain may stabilise the PrD against prion formation by steric means, and implies that the PrD does not induce prion formation by altering the thermodynamic stability of the folded protein.},

abstract = {The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats encoding a long polyQ tract in the respective proteins. To date, a total of nine polyQ disorders have been described: six spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) types 1, 2, 6, 7, 17; Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3); Huntington's disease (HD); dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA); and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, X-linked 1 (SMAX1/SBMA). PolyQ diseases are characterized by the pathological expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeat in the translated region of unrelated genes. The translated polyQ is aggregated in the degenerated neurons leading to the dysfunction and degeneration of specific neuronal subpopulations. Although animal models of polyQ disease for understanding human pathology and accessing disease-modifying therapies in neurodegenerative diseases are available, there is neither a cure nor prevention for these diseases, and only symptomatic treatments for polyQ diseases currently exist. Long-term pharmacological treatment is so far disappointing, probably due to unwanted complications and decreasing drug efficacy. Cellular transplantation of stem cells may provide promising therapeutic avenues for restoration of the functions of degenerative and/or damaged neurons in polyQ diseases.},

abstract = {Multiple yeast prions have been identified that result from the structural conversion of proteins into a self-propagating amyloid form. Amyloid-based prion activity in yeast requires a series of discrete steps. First, the prion protein must form an amyloid nucleus that can recruit and structurally convert additional soluble proteins. Subsequently, maintenance of the prion during cell division requires fragmentation of these aggregates to create new heritable propagons. For the yeast prion protein Sup35, these different activities are encoded for by different regions of Sup35's prion domain. An N-terminal glutamine/asparagine-rich nucleation domain is required for nucleation and fiber growth, while an adjacent oligopeptide repeat domain is largely dispensable for prion nucleation and fiber growth, but required for chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. Although prion activity of glutamine/asparagine-rich proteins is predominantly determined by amino acid composition, the nucleation and oligopeptide repeat domains of Sup35 have distinct compositional requirements. Here, we quantitatively define these compositional requirements in vivo. We show that aromatic residues strongly promote both prion formation and chaperone-dependent prion maintenance. By contrast, non-aromatic hydrophobic residues strongly promote prion formation, but inhibit prion propagation. These results provide insight into why some aggregation-prone proteins are unable to propagate as prions.},

abstract = {Despite extensive study, progress in elucidation of biological functions of amyloids and their role in pathology is largely restrained due to the lack of universal and reliable biochemical methods for their discovery. All biochemical methods developed so far allowed only identification of glutamine/asparagine-rich amyloid-forming proteins or proteins comprising amyloids that form large deposits. In this article we present a proteomic approach which may enable identification of a broad range of amyloid-forming proteins independently of specific features of their sequences or levels of expression. This approach is based on the isolation of protein fractions enriched with amyloid aggregates via sedimentation by ultracentrifugation in the presence of strong ionic detergents, such as sarkosyl or SDS. Sedimented proteins are then separated either by 2D difference gel electrophoresis or by SDS-PAGE, if they are insoluble in the buffer used for 2D difference gel electrophoresis, after which they are identified by mass-spectrometry. We validated this approach by detection of known yeast prions and mammalian proteins with established capacity for amyloid formation and also revealed yeast proteins forming detergent-insoluble aggregates in the presence of human huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine domain. Notably, with one exception, all these proteins contained glutamine/asparagine-rich stretches suggesting that their aggregates arose due to polymerization cross-seeding by human huntingtin. Importantly, though the approach was developed in a yeast model, it can easily be applied to any organism thus representing an efficient and universal tool for screening for amyloid proteins.},

abstract = {The multi-copy 2 micron plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a resident of the nucleus, is remarkable for its high chromosome-like stability. The plasmid does not appear to contribute to the fitness of the host, nor does it impose a significant metabolic burden on the host at its steady state copy number. The plasmid may be viewed as a highly optimized selfish DNA element whose genome design is devoted entirely towards efficient replication, equal segregation and copy number maintenance. A partitioning system comprised of two plasmid coded proteins, Rep1 and Rep2, and a partitioning locus STB is responsible for equal or nearly equal segregation of plasmid molecules to mother and daughter cells. Current evidence supports a model in which the Rep-STB system promotes the physical association of the plasmid with chromosomes and thus plasmid segregation by a hitchhiking mechanism. The Flp site-specific recombination system housed by the plasmid plays a critical role in maintaining steady state plasmid copy number. A decrease in plasmid population due to rare missegregation events is rectified by plasmid amplification via a recombination induced rolling circle replication mechanism. Appropriate plasmid amplification, without runaway increase in copy number, is ensured by positive and negative regulation of FLP gene expression by plasmid coded proteins and by the control of Flp level/activity through host mediated post-translational modification(s) of Flp. The Flp system has been successfully utilized to understand mechanisms of site-specific recombination, to bring about directed genetic alterations for addressing fundamental problems in biology, and as a tool in biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {Essential amino acids (EAA) consist of a group of nine amino acids that animals are unable to synthesize via de novo pathways. Recently, it has been found that most metazoans lack the same set of enzymes responsible for the de novo EAA biosynthesis. Here we investigate the sequence conservation and evolution of all the metazoan remaining genes for EAA pathways. Initially, the set of all 49 enzymes responsible for the EAA de novo biosynthesis in yeast was retrieved. These enzymes were used as BLAST queries to search for similar sequences in a database containing 10 complete metazoan genomes. Eight enzymes typically attributed to EAA pathways were found to be ubiquitous in metazoan genomes, suggesting a conserved functional role. In this study, we address the question of how these genes evolved after losing their pathway partners. To do this, we compared metazoan genes with their fungal and plant orthologs. Using phylogenetic analysis with maximum likelihood, we found that acetolactate synthase (ALS) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) diverged from the expected Tree of Life (ToL) relationships. High sequence conservation in the paraphyletic group Plant-Fungi was identified for these two genes using a newly developed Python algorithm. Selective pressure analysis of ALS and BHMT protein sequences showed higher non-synonymous mutation ratios in comparisons between metazoans/fungi and metazoans/plants, supporting the hypothesis that these two genes have undergone non-ToL evolution in animals.},

We show that neither elongation rate nor translational efficiency is improved by experimental manipulation of the abundance or body sequence of the rare AGG tRNA. Deletion of three of the four copies of the heavily used ACA tRNA shows a modest efficiency decrease that could be explained by other rate-reducing signals at gene start. This suggests that correlation between codon bias and efficiency arises as selection for codons to utilize translation machinery efficiently in highly translated genes. We also show a correlation between efficiency and RNA structure calculated both computationally and from recent structure probing data, as well as the Kozak initiation motif, which may comprise a mechanism to regulate initiation.},

Strong quantitative predictions that follow from energy landscape theory have been widely confirmed both through laboratory folding experiments and from detailed simulations. Energy landscape ideas also have allowed successful protein structure prediction algorithms to be developed. The selection constraint of having funneled folding landscapes has left its imprint on the sequences of existing protein structural families. Quantitative analysis of co-evolution patterns allows us to infer the statistical characteristics of the folding landscape.

abstract = {Prions are transmissible, propagating alternative states of proteins. Prions in budding yeast propagate heritable phenotypes and can function in large-scale gene regulation, or in some cases occur as diseases of yeast. Other 'prionogenic' proteins are likely prions that have been determined experimentally to form amyloid in vivo, and to have prion-like domains that are able to propagate heritable states. Furthermore, there are over 300 additional 'prion-like' yeast proteins that have similar amino-acid composition to prions (primarily a bias for asparagines and glutamines). Here, we examine the protein functional and interaction networks that involve prion, prionogenic and prion-like proteins. Set against a marked overall preference for N/Q-rich prion-like proteins not to interact with each other, we observe a significant tendency of prion/prionogenic proteins to interact with other, N/Q-rich prion-like proteins. This tendency is mostly due to a small number of networks involving the proteins NUP100p, LSM4p and PUB1p. In general, different data analyses of functional and interaction networks converge to indicate a strong linkage of prionogenic and prion-like proteins, to stress-granule assembly and related biological processes. These results further elucidate how prions may impact gene regulation, and reveal a broader horizon for the functional relevance of N/Q-rich prion-like domains.},

abstract = {Prion diseases are associated with accumulation of the amyloid form of the prion protein, but the mechanisms of toxicity are unknown. Amyloid toxicity is also associated with fungal prions. In Podospora anserina, the simultaneous presence of [Het-s] prion and its allelic protein HET-S causes cell death in a self-/nonself-discrimination process. Here, using the prion form of a fragment of HET-s ([PrD(157)(+)]), we show that [Het-s]-HET-S toxicity can be faithfully recapitulated in yeast. Overexpression of Hsp40 chaperone, Sis1, rescues this toxicity by curing cells of [PrD(157)(+)]. We find no evidence for toxic [PrD(157)(+)] conformers in the presence of HET-S. Instead, [PrD(157)(+)] appears to seed HET-S to accumulate at the cell periphery and to form aggregates distinct from visible [PrD(157)(+)] aggregates. Furthermore, HET-S mutants that cause HET-S to be sequestered into [PrD(157)(+)] prion aggregates are not toxic. The localization of HET-S at the cell periphery and its association with cell death was also observed in the native host Podospora anserina. Thus, upon interaction with [Het-s], HET-S localizes to the cell periphery, and this relocalization, rather than the formation of mixed HET-s/HET-S aggregates, is associated with toxicity.},

PrD HET-s: 218-289 (C-конец). Этот участок необходим и достаточен для образования и поддержания приона в Podospora и дрожжах и для формирования амилоида in vitro. 
1-227: домен HeLo, который определяет принадлежность белка к HET-s или HET-S.
В клетках Podospora прион может формировать прионный домен любой из двух аллелей, но только один из двух полноразмерных белков. Следовательно, HET-S HeLo ингибирует формирование приона PrD. In vitro тоже.
Показано, что Het-S не агрегирует сам по себе и не коагрегирует с Het-s in vitro, но при этом было показано, что формирование бета-соленоида PrD белка HET-S необходимо для токсичности. Существовало предположение, что амилоидизация PrD HET-S приводит к изменению конформации домена HeLo и к димеризации HeLo, но дальнейшая связь с токсичностью непонятна.

PrD157-GFP в дрожжах может прионизоваться.
Ранее уже показывали, что при низком уровне экспрессии продукт такого гена под галактозным промотором диффузный, а при высоком образует кольца, и дочерние клетки получают 2 светящиеся точки даже тогда, когда экспрессия возвращается к нормальному уровню.
Для этой работы сделали систему с GPD-промотором. В этом случае сложно получить чистую культуру клеток без приона. А промотор GAL1 уже был занят (сверхэкспрессия HET-S).
В отличие от только PrD, участок со 157 ак до C-конца при экспрессии с GPD-промотора даёт диффузно распределённый продукт. 

        

        
1B. Если коэкспрессировать PrD157-GFP и PrD, формируется наследуемый амилоид. Передаётся цитодукцией. 
PrD образует прион из двух точек на клетку, разрушается SDS, но не саркозилом, и ингибирует рост, а PrD157 -- m.d., устойчивый к SDS, не ингибирует рост.

4B: при скрещивании с клетками PrD157+ HET-S-DsRed образует агрегаты по периферии клетки. Почек такие клетки больше не образуют. 
Если клетки и сливались, то красились трипановым синим.
4C: у prd157- всё в порядке.

Для клеток PrD+ всё примерно так же. 

        

        
Figure 6
Если убивать клетки PSI+ сверхэкспрессией SUP35, HET-S не агрегирует. Значит, дело во взаимодействии конкретных белков, а не в общем грузе амилоидов.

        

        
Figure 7
Ситуация у Podospora схожая. 
Локализация HET-S на периферии клетки была связана с токсичностью, в отличие от формирования агрегатов.

        

        
HET-S связывается как с прионной, так и с неприонной формами PrD157-GFP.

abstract = {The [PSI+] nonsense-suppressor determinant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from the ability of Sup35 (eRF3) translation termination factor to undergo prion-like aggregation [1]. Although this process is autocatalytic, in vivo it depends on the chaperone Hsp104, whose lack or overexpression can cure [PSI+] [2]. Overproduction of the chaperone protein Ssb1 increased the [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104, although it had no effect on its own, and excess chaperone protein Ssa1 protected [PSI+] against Hsp104 [3,4]. We used an artificial [PSI+PS] based on the Sup35 prion-forming domain from yeast Pichia methanolica[5] to find other prion-curing factors. Both [PSI+PS] and [PSI+] have prion ‘strains’, differing in their suppressor efficiency and mitotic stability. We show that [PSI+PS] and a ‘weak’ strain of [PSI+] can be cured by overexpression of chaperones Ssa1, Ssb1 and Ydj1. The ability of different chaperones to cure [PSI+PS] showed significant prion strain specificity, which could be related to variation in Sup35 prion structure. Our results imply that homologs of these chaperones may be active against mammalian prion and amyloid diseases.},

Caffeine is a major component of coffee and is used widely in food and beverage industries. Most of the enzymes involved in the caffeine biosynthetic pathway have been reported previously. Here, we demonstrated the biosynthesis of caffeine (0.38 mg/L) by co-expression of Coffea arabica xanthosine methyltransferase (CaXMT) and Camellia sinensis caffeine synthase (TCS) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, we endeavored to develop this production platform for making other purine-based alkaloids. To increase the catalytic activity of TCS in an effort to increase theobromine production, we identified four amino acid residues based on structural analyses of 3D-model of TCS. Two TCS1 mutants (Val317Met and Phe217Trp) slightly increased in theobromine accumulation and simultaneously decreased in caffeine production. The application and further optimization of this biosynthetic platform are discussed.},

abstract = {Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with conversion of a soluble protein into amyloid deposits, but how this is connected to toxicity remains largely unknown. Here, we explore mechanisms of amyloid associated toxicity using yeast. [PIN(+)], the prion form of the Q/N-rich Rnq1 protein, was known to enhance aggregation of heterologous proteins, including the overexpressed Q/N-rich amyloid forming domain of Pin4 (Pin4C), and Pin4C aggregates were known to attract chaperones, including Sis1. Here we show that in [PIN(+)] but not [pin(-)] cells, overexpression of Pin4C is deadly and linked to hyperphosphorylation of aggregated Pin4C. Furthermore, Pin4C aggregation, hyperphosphorylation and toxicity are simultaneously reversed by Sis1 overexpression. Toxicity may result from proteasome overload because hyperphosphorylated Pin4C aggregation is associated with reduced degradation of a ubiquitin-protein degradation reporter. Finally, hyperphosphorylation of endogenous full-length Pin4 was also facilitated by [PIN(+)], revealing that a prion can regulate post-translational modification of another protein.},

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

A given protein may adopt multiple amyloid conformations, known as variants or strains, each of which leads to a distinct disease pattern or phenotype. Here, we study the effect of Hofmeister ions on amyloid nucleation and strain generation by the prion domain-containing fragment (Sup35NM) of a yeast protein Sup35p. Strongly hydrated anions (kosmotropes) initiate nucleation quickly and cause rapid fiber elongation, whereas poorly hydrated anions (chaotropes) delay nucleation and mildly affect the elongation rate. For the first time, we demonstrate that kosmotropes favor formation of amyloid strains that are characterized by lower thermostability and higher frangibility in vitro and stronger phenotypic and proliferation patterns effectively in vivo as compared with amyloids formed in chaotropes. These phenomena point to inherent differences in the biochemistry of Hofmeister ions. Our work shows that the ionic composition of a solution not only influences the kinetics of amyloid nucleation but also determines the amyloid strain that is preferentially formed.},

Previously, we reported that the kinase and transcription elongation factor Ctk1 increases fidelity during translation elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that loss of Ctk1 function also affects the initiation step of translation. Translation active extracts from Ctk1 depleted cells show impaired translation activity of capped, but not CrPV IRES containing mRNA reporters. Furthermore, the formation of 80S initiation complexes is decreased, which is probably due to reduced subunit joining. In addition, we determined the changes in the phosphorylation pattern of a ribosome enriched fraction after depletion of Ctk1. Thus, we provide a catalogue of phosphoproteomic changes dependent on Ctk1. Taken together, our data suggest a stimulatory function of Ctk1 in 80S formation during translation initiation.},

To identify systematically processes affecting size control in G1 in budding yeast, we imaged and analyzed the cell cycle of millions of individual cells representing 591 mutants implicated in size control. Quantitative metric distinguished mutants affecting the mechanism of size control from the majority of mutants that have a perturbed size due to indirect effects modulating cell growth. Overall, we identified 17 negative and dozens positive size control regulators, with the negative regulators forming a small network centered on elements of mitotic exit network. Some elements of the translation machinery affected size control with a notable distinction between the deletions of parts of small and large ribosomal subunit: parts of small ribosomal subunit tended to regulate size control, while parts of the large subunit affected cell growth. Analysis of small cells revealed additional size control mechanism that functions in G2/M, complementing the primary size control in G1. Our study provides new insights about size control mechanisms in budding yeast.},

It is not clear how size is measured and how the characteristicsize is determined, but protein translation appears to play a central role (Johnston et al, 1977; Popolo et al, 1982; Moore, 1988). Both the rate of translation and the rate of ribosomal biogenesis affect cell size (Jorgensen {\&}amp; Tyers, 2004; Bernstein et al, 2007; Moretto et al, 2013).

As expected, the majority of small mutants lacked components ofthe ribosomes (P {\&}lt; 10?10) or were deleted of genes involved in ribo- somal assembly and biogenesis (P {\&}lt; 10?4).

abstract = {[URE3] is an amyloid prion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism. Overproduction of Btn2p, involved in late endosome to Golgi protein transport, or its paralog Cur1p, cures [URE3]. Btn2p, in curing, is colocalized with Ure2p in a single locus, suggesting sequestration of Ure2p amyloid filaments. We find that most [URE3] variants generated in a btn2 cur1 double mutant are cured by restoring normal levels of Btn2p and Cur1p, with both proteins needed for efficient curing. The [URE3] variants cured by normal levels of Btn2p and Cur1p all have low seed number, again suggesting a seed sequestration mechanism. Hsp42 overproduction also cures [URE3], and Hsp42p aids Btn2 overproduction curing. Cur1p is needed for Hsp42 overproduction curing of [URE3], but neither Btn2p nor Cur1p is needed for overproduction curing by the other. Although hsp42$\Delta$ strains stably propagate [URE3-1], hsp26$\Delta$ destabilizes this prion. Thus, Btn2p and Cur1p are antiprion system components at their normal levels, acting with Hsp42. Btn2p is related in sequence to human Hook proteins, involved in aggresome formation and other transport activities.},

abstract = {Hsp100 family chaperones of microorganisms and plants cooperate with the Hsp70/Hsp40/NEF system to resolubilize and reactivate stress-denatured proteins. In yeast this machinery also promotes propagation of prions by fragmenting prion polymers. We previously showed the bacterial Hsp100 machinery cooperates with the yeast Hsp40 Ydj1 to support yeast thermotolerance and with the yeast Hsp40 Sis1 to propagate [PSI+] prions. Here we find these Hsp40s similarly directed specific activities of the yeast Hsp104-based machinery. By assessing the ability of Ydj1-Sis1 hybrid proteins to complement Ydj1 and Sis1 functions we show their C-terminal substrate-binding domains determined distinctions in these and other cellular functions of Ydj1 and Sis1. We find propagation of [URE3] prions was acutely sensitive to alterations in Sis1 activity, while that of [PIN+] prions was less sensitive than [URE3], but more sensitive than [PSI+]. These findings support the ideas that overexpressing Ydj1 cures [URE3] by competing with Sis1 for interaction with the Hsp104-based disaggregation machine, and that different prions rely differently on activity of this machinery, which can explain the various ways they respond to alterations in chaperone function.},

abstract = {Molecular chaperones monitor protein homeostasis and defend against the misfolding and aggregation of proteins that is associated with protein conformational disorders. In these diseases, a variety of different aggregate structures can form. These are called prion strains, or variants, in prion diseases, and cause variation in disease pathogenesis. Here, we use variants of the yeast prions [RNQ+] and [PSI+] to explore the interactions of chaperones with distinct aggregate structures. We found that prion variants show striking variation in their relationship with Hsp40s. Specifically, the yeast Hsp40 Sis1 and its human orthologue Hdj1 had differential capacities to process prion variants, suggesting that Hsp40 selectivity has likely changed through evolution. We further show that such selectivity involves different domains of Sis1, with some prion conformers having a greater dependence on particular Hsp40 domains. Moreover, [PSI+] variants were more sensitive to certain alterations in Hsp70 activity as compared to [RNQ+] variants. Collectively, our data indicate that distinct chaperone machinery is required, or has differential capacity, to process different aggregate structures. Elucidating the intricacies of chaperone-client interactions, and how these are altered by particular client structures, will be crucial to understanding how this system can go awry in disease and contribute to pathological variation.},

abstract = {During termination of translation in eukaryotes, a GTP-binding protein, eRF3, functions within a complex with the tRNA-mimicking protein, eRF1, to decode stop codons. It remains unclear how the tRNA-mimicking protein co-operates with the GTPase and with the functional sites on the ribosome. In order to elucidate the molecular characteristics of tRNA-mimicking proteins involved in stop codon decoding, we have devised a heterologous genetic system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that eRF3 from Pneumocystis carinii (Pc-eRF3) did not complement depletion of S. cerevisiae eRF3. The strength of Pc-eRF3 binding to Sc-eRF1 depends on the GTP-binding domain, suggesting that defects of the GTPase switch in the heterologous complex causes the observed lethality. We isolated mutants of Pc-eRF3 and Sc-eRF1 that restore cell growth in the presence of Pc-eRF3 as the sole source of eRF3. Mapping of these mutations onto the latest 3D-complex structure revealed that they were located in the binding-interface region between eRF1 and eRF3, as well as in the ribosomal functional sites. Intriguingly, a novel functional site was revealed adjacent to the decoding site of eRF1, on the tip domain that mimics the tRNA anticodon loop. This novel domain likely participates in codon recognition, coupled with the GTPase function.},

This result suggests a potential explanation for the somewhat puzzling fact that duplicated RP genes are not functionally redundant despite their very high protein sequence identity.

The accuracy of our method is over 99.5{\%} in 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the annotation data in Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), we studied the coding capacity of all 1744 ORFs which lack experimental results and suggested that the overall number of chromosomal ORFs encoding proteins in yeast should be 6091 by removing 488 spurious ORFs. The importance of the present work lies in at least two aspects. First, cross-validation and retrospective examination showed the fidelity of our method in recognizing ORFs that likely encode proteins. Second, we have provided a web service that can be accessed at http://cobi.uestc.edu.cn/services/yeast/, which enables the prediction of protein-coding ORFs of the genus Saccharomyces with a high accuracy.},

abstract = {Protein biosynthesis is an orderly process that requires a balance between rate and accuracy. To produce a functional product, the fidelity of this process has to be maintained from start to finish. In order to systematically identify genes that affect stop codon bypass, three expression plasmids, pUKC817, pUKC818 and pUKC819, were integrated into the yeast non-essential loss-of-function gene array (5000 strains). These plasmids contain three different premature stop codons (UAA, UGA and UAG, respectively) within the LacZ expression cassette. A fourth plasmid, pUKC815 that carries the native LacZ gene was used as a control. Transformed strains were subjected to large-scale $\beta$-galactosidase lift assay analysis to evaluate production of $\beta$-galactosidase for each gene deletion strain. In this way 84 potential candidate genes that affect stop codon bypass were identified. Three candidate genes, OLA1, BSC2, and YNL040W, were further investigated, and were found to be important for cytoplasmic protein biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Prions are self-perpetuating protein isoforms that cause fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disease in mammals. Recent evidence indicates that a majority of human proteins involved in amyloid and neural inclusion disorders possess at least some prion properties. In lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, prions act as epigenetic elements, which increase phenotypic diversity by altering a range of cellular processes. While some yeast prions are clearly pathogenic, it is also postulated that prion formation could be beneficial in variable environmental conditions. Yeast and mammalian prions have similar molecular properties. Crucial cellular factors and conditions influencing prion formation and propagation were uncovered in the yeast models. Stress-related chaperones, protein quality control deposits, degradation pathways, and cytoskeletal networks control prion formation and propagation in yeast. Environmental stresses trigger prion formation and loss, supposedly acting via influencing intracellular concentrations of the prion-inducing proteins, and/or by localizing prionogenic proteins to the prion induction sites via heterologous ancillary helpers. Physiological and environmental modulation of yeast prions points to new opportunities for pharmacological intervention and/or prophylactic measures targeting general cellular systems rather than the properties of individual amyloids and prions.},

abstract = {Chromosome instability is a key component of cancer progression and many heritable diseases. Understanding why some chromosomes are more unstable than others could provide insight into understanding genome integrity. Here we systematically investigate the spontaneous chromosome loss for all sixteen chromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying chromosome instability. We observed that the stability of different chromosomes varied more than 100-fold. Consistent with previous studies on artificial chromosomes, chromosome loss frequency was negatively correlated to chromosome length in S. cerevisiae diploids, triploids and S. cerevisiae-S. bayanus hybrids. Chromosome III, an equivalent of sex chromosomes in budding yeast, was found to be the most unstable chromosome among all cases examined. Moreover, similar instability was observed in chromosome III of S. bayanus, a species that diverged from S. cerevisiae about 20 million years ago, suggesting that the instability is caused by a conserved mechanism. Chromosome III was found to have a highly relaxed spindle checkpoint response in the genome. Using a plasmid stability assay, we found that differences in the centromeric sequence may explain certain aspects of chromosome instability. Our results reveal that even under normal conditions, individual chromosomes in a genome are subject to different levels of pressure in chromosome loss (or gain).},

We have characterized one aspect of aneuploidy: the gain of extra chromosomes. We created a collection of haploid yeast strains that each bear an extra copy of one or more of almost all of the yeast chromosomes. Their characterization revealed that aneuploid strains share a number of phenotypes, including defects in cell cycle progression, increased glucose uptake, and increased sensitivity to conditions interfering with protein synthesis and protein folding. These phenotypes were observed only in strains carrying additional yeast genes, which indicates that they reflect the consequences of additional protein production as well as the resulting imbalances in cellular protein composition. We conclude that aneuploidy causes not only a proliferative disadvantage but also a set of phenotypes that is independent of the identity of the individual extra chromosomes.},

Влияние анеуплоидии на физиологию и деление гаплоидных клеток дрожжей

Клеточный цикл — это очень жёстко контролируемый процесс, в результате которого получаются две дочерние клетки одинакового генетического состава
{\#}word genetic makeup {\~{}} генотипический фон
Механизмы контроля (КП) обеспечивают прохождение этого процесса с высокой точностью. Тем не менее, даже при их наличии нерасхождение хромосом происходит в дрожжевых клетках с частотой примерно 1/500,000 делений (Niwa, Tange, Kurabayashi Yeast 2006) [btw это S. pombe!] и что-то между 10,000 и 100,000 в клетках млекопитающих ={\&}gt; это называется анеуплоидия.
Более столетия назад анеуплоидия была признана общей характеристикой раковых клеток. Затем предположили, что анеуплоидия способствует образованию опухолей, потому что представляет собой механизм потери генов-онкосупрессоров или приобретения дополнительных копий онкогенов. Исследования, в которых изучали влияние анеуплодидии на деление клеток Spombe и дрозофилы и влияние трисомии на пролиферацию человеческих клетока, подсказывают, что анеуплоидия может мешать пролиферации
{\#}word genes are gained ={\&}gt; приобретение дополнительных копий генов???

Чтобы оценить влияние анеуплоидии на пролиферацию и физиологию нормальных клеток, создали набор дрожжевых штаммов с одной или несколькими дополнительными хромосомами ={\&}gt; всесторонний анализ
{\#}word comprehensive analysis ={\&}gt; всесторонний?
Кроме специфических для каждого анеуплоида особенностей фенотипа, мы нашли ряд признаков, свидетельствующих о наличии общего ответа клетки на анеуплоидию

Создание штаммов: стратегия переноса хромосомы. Если один из партнёров для скрещивания дефектен по KAR1, кариогамия не происходит, но иногда переносятся отдельные хромосомы. 
{\#}mm ссылки на статьи про цитодукцию
Если штаммы маркированы, можно отбирать. Так сделали 13 из 16 возможных дисомиков. Проверили CGH. Выяснили, что у некоторых есть ещё лишние хромосомы, на присутствие которых не отбирали. Несмотря на то что отбирать на наличие этих хромосом было нельзя, кариотипы оказались достаточно стабильными, чтобы их охарактеризовать. 

II. Транскрипционный ответ. 

Вырастили каждый штамм до среднего логарифма и выделили РНК ={\&}gt; гибридизация с чипами. Экспрессия большинства генов на дуплицированных хромосомах действительно увеличилась в два раза. Раньше (Hudges 2001) подобное уже показывали на меньшем наборе данных. Чтобы выявить более тонкую корреляцию, замаскированную сигналом по всей хромосоме, применили кластеризацию с изменённым весом для генов удвоенных хромосом. Многие дисомики, особенно IV, XIII, XV, XVI, демонстрировали профиль, очень похожий на ESR. Частично похоже на cdc28-4 (задержка в G1) или cdc23-1
Все изученные анеуплоидные штаммы делились медленнее, чем штамм дикого типа. Следовательно, профили экспрессии могли быть связаны с разницей в скорости роста. Чтобы уравнять их в правах, выращивали в хемостате в условиях недостатка фосфата. Затем выявили гены, экспрессия которых меняется хотя бы в 10 из 14 штаммов ={\&}gt; GO ={\&}gt; increased: ribosomal biogenesis (esp. rRNA processing), nucleic acid metabolism; decreased: carbohydrate metabolist.

III. Большинство анеуплоидных штаммов застревают в G1. 

Чтобы выявить влияние на физиологию клеток, сравнили рост в YPD и -His+G418 (во втором случае селекция на поддержание дополнительной хромосомы). Большинство делится чуть медленнее. Даже те, которые делятся не медленнее, чем дикий тип (дисомики I, II), проигрывают в соревновании. Для диплоидов похожие результаты. Значит, анеуплоиды у дрожжей не похожи в этом отношении на раковые клетки. 
На какой стадии клеточного цикла застревают? Проверили выползание из ареста в G1 с помощью феромонов. Замедлено у всех, кроме I, II, V, IX. У 2 metaphase ={\&}gt; anaphase, ещё у 2 вход в митоз (у disII всё хорошо). Похоже на корреляцию с длиной лишней хромосомы. 
Контроль перехода G1→S хорошо изучен. CDK Cdc28 + Cln3 —| Whi5 —| SBF → CLN1{\&}amp;CLN2; Cln1{\&}amp;2 + Cdc28 → entry! Проверили для самых несчастных штаммов уровень мРНК и белка Cln2. И правда меньше. Следовательно, анеуплоидия действует раньше, чем G1 → S. Механизм? Может быть, проблемы с Cln3-CDK?

IV. Анеуплоиды едят больше глюкозы. 

Измерили кинетику входа в стационар. Большинство анеуплоидов достигали насыщения при меньшем OD и теряли жизнеспособность при дальнейшем кулитивировании. Опять чем больше лишней ДНК, тем заметнее эффект.
Связано ли с недостатком еды? Да. wt даёт больше биомассы в пересчёте на количество глюкозы. Чем меньше время деления, тем эффективнее.
Измерили количество ДНК и РНК HXT6/7 (без деталей эксперимента). Выяснили, что в большинстве анеуплоидных штаммов становится либо больше ДНК, либо больше РНК. Исключение — дисомик по VIII, на которой, собственно, эти гены и есть. (тут я что-то перестала понимать, ну да ладно)

Большинство дуплицированных генов экспрессируются
Что-то вроде 60 или 90{\%} химической энергии в клетке идёт на продукцию белков, поэтому предположили, что биосинтез макромолекул, закодированных на дополнительной хромосоме, может быть причиной дополнительного потребления глюкозы. И правда, большинство генов лишних хромосом транскрибируется (93{\%} хотя бы 1.3x, 83{\%} хотя бы 1.5x). Измерили уровни Arp5, Tcp1, Cdc28, похоже ={\&}gt; они ещё и транслируются! Но большинство белков, которые они анализировали, не увеличивались в количестве, хотя мРНК становилось больше. И они компоненты комплексов. Похоже, либо их синтезируется меньше, либо они быстро деградируют.
Протестировали влияние MG132 (штаммы с несколькими дополнительными хромосомами здесь не проверяли, т.к. нужно было делетировать pdr5 (не поняла суть проблемы: маркер делеции, что ли?). Все были чувствительны к циклогексимиду.

VI. Пролиферация анеуплоидов ингибируется ингибиторами трансляции и высокой температурой. 

Всем кроме I, X и XIV не понравилось добавление 20 ug/ml тиолютина, ингибитора РНК-полимеразы
Всем не понравился циклогексимид (0.1-0.2 ug/ml)
Все, кроме I, II, IX (ой!), чувствительны к гигромицину и рапамицину. X нечувствителен к рапамицину из-за TOR1, скорее всего.
Дело не в общей проблеме пролиферации, т.к. мутанты по cdc не обладают какой-то особой чувствительностью к циклогексимиду или рапамицину. 
При повышенной температуре (и, вероятно, накоплении неправильно уложенных белков) все штаммы, кроме I (хм...), делились хуже. И все, кроме X, были немного более чувствительны к гельданамицину, ингибитору Hsp90. 
Другие гадости: гидроксимочевина, AZC (аналог пролина) и азаурацил их не впечатлили, хлороквин и перекись водорода тоже. Глицерин и олигомицин тоже. К беномилу были чувствительны не все, что требует отдельного изучения. 

VII. Дело в дополнительных генах дрожжей, а не в наличии дополнительной ДНК per se.

Взяли YACs (350 kb — 1.6 Mb). Профиль экспрессии генов в условиях недостатка фосфата очень похожий! Но остальные фенотипы другие. Только самая большая искусственная хромосома замедляла вход в митоз и чувствительность к гигромицину (причина не совсем понятна).},

abstract = {Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation. The most direct and unbiased method of studying spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) lines. Until recently, MA experiments were limited by the cost of sequencing and thus provided us with small numbers of mutational events and therefore imprecise estimates of rates and patterns of mutation. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify nearly 1,000 spontaneous mutation events accumulated over ∼311,000 generations in 145 diploid MA lines of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MA experiments are usually assumed to have negligible levels of selection, but even mild selection will remove strongly deleterious events. We take advantage of such patterns of selection and show that mutation classes such as indels and aneuploidies (especially monosomies) are proportionately much more likely to contribute mutations of large effect. We also provide conservative estimates of indel, aneuploidy, environment-dependent dominant lethal, and recessive lethal mutation rates. To our knowledge, for the first time in yeast MA data, we identified a sufficiently large number of single-nucleotide mutations to measure context-dependent mutation rates and were able to (i) confirm strong AT bias of mutation in yeast driven by high rate of mutations from C/G to T/A and (ii) detect a higher rate of mutation at C/G nucleotides in two specific contexts consistent with cytosine methylation in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy--the state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes--is a hallmark of cancer and a feature identified in yeast from diverse habitats. Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions. Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly. Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Short-term exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy, a chromosome content that is not a multiple of the haploid karyotype, is associated with reduced fitness in all organisms analyzed to date. In budding yeast aneuploidy causes cell proliferation defects, with many different aneuploid strains exhibiting a delay in G1, a cell cycle stage governed by extracellular cues, growth rate, and cell cycle events. Here we characterize this G1 delay. We show that 10 of 14 aneuploid yeast strains exhibit a growth defect during G1. Furthermore, 10 of 14 aneuploid strains display a cell cycle entry delay that correlates with the size of the additional chromosome. This cell cycle entry delay is due to a delayed accumulation of G1 cyclins that can be suppressed by supplying cells with high levels of a G1 cyclin. Our results indicate that aneuploidy frequently interferes with the ability of cells to grow and, as with many other cellular stresses, entry into the cell cycle.},

abstract = {In the diploid cells of most organisms, including humans, each chromosome is usually distinguishable from its partner homolog by multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One common type of genetic alteration observed in tumor cells is uniparental disomy (UPD), in which a pair of homologous chromosomes are derived from a single parent, resulting in loss of heterozygosity for all single-nucleotide polymorphisms while maintaining diploidy. Somatic UPD events are usually explained as reflecting two consecutive nondisjunction events. Here we report a previously undescribed mode of chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which one cell division produces daughter cells with reciprocal UPD for the same pair of chromosomes without an aneuploid intermediate. One pair of sister chromatids is segregated into one daughter cell and the other pair is segregated into the other daughter cell, mimicking a meiotic chromosome segregation pattern. We term this process "reciprocal uniparental disomy."},

Furthermore, we find that aneuploid cells exhibit phenotypes consistent with increased energy need and proteotoxic stress. These observations, together with the finding that the additional chromosomes found in aneuploid cells are active, lead us to propose that aneuploidy causes an increased burden on protein synthesis and protein quality-control pathways and so induces an aneuploidy stress response.},

abstract = {When cells in our body change their genome and develop into cancer, we blame it on genome instability. When novel species conquer inhospitable environments, we credit it to genome evolution. From a cellular perspective, however, both processes are outcomes of the same fundamental biological properties-genome and pathway plasticity and the natural selection of cells that escape death and acquire growth advantages. Unraveling the consequences of genome plasticity at a cellular level is not only central to the understanding of species evolution but also crucial to deciphering important cell biological problems, such as how cancer cells emerge and how pathogens develop drug resistance. Aside from the well-known role of DNA sequence mutations, recent evidence suggests that changes in DNA copy numbers in the form of segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidy can bring about large phenotypic variation. Although usually detrimental under conditions suitable for normal proliferation of euploid cells, aneuploidization may be a frequently occurring genetic change that enables pathogens or cancer cells to escape physiological or pharmacological roadblocks.},

To probe this question, we identified aneuploid yeast strains with improved proliferative abilities. Their molecular characterization revealed strain-specific genetic alterations as well as mutations shared between different aneuploid strains. Among the latter, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 improves growth rates in four different aneuploid yeast strains by attenuating the changes in intracellular protein composition caused by aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate the existence of aneuploidy-tolerating mutations that improve the fitness of multiple different aneuploidies and highlight the importance of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation in suppressing the adverse effects of aneuploidy.},

abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating {\~{}}356,660 candidate SNPs in {\~{}}117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of {\~{}}1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that {\~{}}15,842 SNPs are synonymous and {\~{}}4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S {\~{}}0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

abstract = {Genetic variants identified by mapping are biased toward large phenotypic effects because of methodological challenges for detecting genetic variants with small phenotypic effects. Recently, bulk segregant analysis combined with next generation sequencing (BSA-seq) was shown to be a powerful and cost-effective way to map small effect variants in natural populations. Here, we examine the power of BSA-seq for efficiently mapping small effect mutations isolated from a mutagenesis screen. Specifically, we determined the impact of segregant population size, intensity of phenotypic selection to collect segregants, number of mitotic generations between meiosis and sequencing, and average sequencing depth on power for mapping mutations with a range of effects on the phenotypic mean and standard deviation as well as relative fitness. We then used BSA-seq to map the mutations responsible for three EMS-induced mutant phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These mutants display small quantitative variation in the mean expression of a fluorescent reporter gene (-3{\%}, +7{\%} and +10{\%}). Using a genetic background with increased meiosis rate, a reliable mating type marker, and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to efficiently score large segregating populations and isolate cells with extreme phenotypes, we successfully mapped and functionally confirmed a single point mutation responsible for the mutant phenotype in all three cases. Our simulations and experimental data show that the effects of a causative site not only on the mean phenotype, but also on its standard deviation and relative fitness should be considered when mapping genetic variants in microorganisms such as yeast that require population growth steps for BSA-seq.},

Analysis of Illumina sequencing data
For each sample, FASTQ files containing all paired-end reads data
were generated with CASAVA v1.8.2 software. 
Before alignment, low-quality ends were trimmed from reads using sickle v1.2 (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) with default settings (2q 20 –l 20). 
Trimmed reads were then aligned to the S288c reference genome (http://www.yeastgenome.org, R64 release from 03-Feb-2011) with P TDH3 -YFP
inserted on chromosome I using Bowtie2 v2.1.0 (bowtie2 -p 2 -x ref.fasta 21 SampleX.R1.fastq 22 SampleX.R2.fastq 2I 0 -X 900 2S
SampleX.sam –t; Langmead and Salzberg 2012). 
Next, bamUtil v1.0.9 was used to clip overlaps between mate reads that could bias our estimation of allele frequencies (bam clipOverlap–in SampleX.sam–out SampleX.clipped.sam–stats–readName). 
MPILEUP files containing base calls from overlapping reads at each genomic position were generated with SAMtools v0.1.19 (samtools view –q 10 –bS; samtools sort; samtools mpileup –BD –f; Li et al. 2009).

        
For each mutant, two different MPILEUP files were generated: one was used to call a set of high confidence single-nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) using VarScan v2.3.6 (Koboldt et al. 2009, 2012; http://varscan.sourceforge.net), and the other was used to estimate
allele frequencies for a broader set of genomic positions using Popoolation2 v1.201 (Kofler et al. 2011). The first MPILEUP file was
obtained from a BAM file containing sequencing data for the mapping strain and another BAM file merging reads for the low and high
fluorescence bulks. SNPs were called using VarScan somatic and somaticFilter commands with the mapping strain considered as “nor-
mal” and the merged F 1 segregant bulks as “tumor” (somatic–min-coverage 5–min-var-frequation 0.01; somaticFilter–min-coverage
5–min-reads2 3–min-strands2 2–min-var-frequation 0.05). Filtering out sites with strong strand bias was critical to remove false positive variants. In parallel, the second MPILEUP file was generated from two separate BAM files containing reads data for the low and high bulks.
Allele frequencies at variable sites were computed using Popoolation2 (mpileup2sync.jar–min-qual 20–threads 2; snp-frequency-diff.pl–min-
count 10–min-coverage 10–max-coverage 500). 

        
Finally, G tests were computed for each variable sites using likelihood.test() function from the R package Deducer (Fellows 2012). A
large fraction of variable sites identified through Popoolation2 were absent from the set of high confidence SNPs obtained with VarScan
and were removed before plotting P-values of G-tests. Mutant alleles at these sites were considered as mapping errors as they usually oc-
curred at low frequency, at the end of reads or only in one strand direction.

abstract = {Lager yeast beer production was revolutionized by the introduction of pure culture strains. The first established lager yeast strain is known as the bottom fermenting Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, which was originally termed Unterhefe No. 1 by Emil Chr. Hansen and has been used in production in since 1883. S. carlsbergensis belongs to group I/Saaz-type lager yeast strains and is better adapted to cold growth conditions than group II/Frohberg-type lager yeasts, e.g., the Weihenstephan strain WS34/70. Here, we sequenced S. carlsbergensis using next generation sequencing technologies. Lager yeasts are descendants from hybrids formed between a S. cerevisiae parent and a parent similar to S. eubayanus. Accordingly, the S. carlsbergensis 19.5-Mb genome is substantially larger than the 12-Mb S. cerevisiae genome. Based on the sequence scaffolds, synteny to the S. cerevisae genome, and by using directed polymerase chain reaction for gap closure, we generated a chromosomal map of S. carlsbergensis consisting of 29 unique chromosomes. We present evidence for genome and chromosome evolution within S. carlsbergensis via chromosome loss and loss of heterozygosity specifically of parts derived from the S. cerevisiae parent. Based on our sequence data and via fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, we determined the ploidy of S. carlsbergensis. This inferred that this strain is basically triploid with a diploid S. eubayanus and haploid S. cerevisiae genome content. In contrast the Weihenstephan strain, which we resequenced, is essentially tetraploid composed of two diploid S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus genomes. Based on conserved translocations between the parental genomes in S. carlsbergensis and the Weihenstephan strain we propose a joint evolutionary ancestry for lager yeast strains.},

abstract = {Classic functions of the actin cytoskeleton include control of cell size and shape and the internal organization of cells. These functions are manifest in cellular processes of fundamental importance throughout biology such as the generation of cell polarity, cell migration, cell adhesion, and cell division. However, studies in the unicellular model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) are giving insights into other functions in which the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role. These include endocytosis, control of protein translation, and determination of protein 3-dimensional shape (especially conversion of normal cellular proteins into prions). Here, we present a concise overview of these new "moonlighting" roles for the actin cytoskeleton and how some of these roles might lie at the heart of important molecular switches. This is an exciting time for researchers interested in the actin cytoskeleton. We show here how studies of actin are leading us into many new and exciting realms at the interface of genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology. While many of the pioneering studies have been conducted using yeast, the conservation of the actin cytoskeleton and its component proteins throughout eukaryotes suggests that these new roles for the actin cytoskeleton may not be restricted to yeast cells but rather may reflect new roles for the actin cytoskeleton of all eukaryotes. © 2014 IUBMB Life, 2014.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy, referring here to genome contents characterized by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, has been associated with developmental defects, cancer and adaptive evolution in experimental organisms. However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring about phenotypic variation and improved fitness over that of euploid counterparts. Here we show, using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phenotypic profiling, that levels of protein expression in aneuploid yeast strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same trend as that observed for the transcriptome, and that aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme to generate, through random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection. Through quantitative growth assays under various conditions or in the presence of a panel of chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that some aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid control strains under conditions suboptimal for the latter. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy directly affects gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is dependent on context and karyotype, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to reproductive isolation is essential for understanding population structure and speciation. While several models have been advanced to explain post-mating reproductive isolation, experimental data supporting most are indirect. Laboratory investigations of this phenomenon are typically carried out under benign conditions, which result in low rates of genetic change unlikely to initiate reproductive isolation. Previously, we described an experimental system using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where starvation served as a proxy to any stress that decreases reproduction and/or survivorship. We showed that novel lineages with restructured genomes quickly emerged in starved populations, and that these survivors were more fit than their ancestors when re-starved. Here we show that certain yeast lineages that survive starvation have become reproductively isolated from their ancestor. We further demonstrate that reproductive isolation arises from genomic rearrangements, whose frequency in starving yeast is several orders of magnitude greater than an unstarved control. By contrast, the frequency of point mutations is less than 2-fold greater. In a particular case, we observe that a starved lineage becomes reproductively isolated as a direct result of the stress-related accumulation of a single chromosome. We recapitulate this result by demonstrating that introducing an extra copy of one or several chromosomes into na{\"{\i}}ve, i.e. unstarved, yeast significantly diminishes their fertility. This type of reproductive barrier, whether arising spontaneously or via genetic manipulation, can be removed by making a lineage euploid for the altered chromosomes. Our model provides direct genetic evidence that reproductive isolation can arise frequently in stressed populations via genome restructuring without the precondition of geographic isolation.},

@article{Anders2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most methods for constructing aneuploid yeast strains that have gained a specific chromosome rely on spontaneous failures of cell division fidelity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extra chromosomes can be obtained when errors in meiosis or mitosis lead to nondisjunction, or when nuclear breakdown occurs in heterokaryons. We describe a strategy for constructing N+1 disomes that does not require such spontaneous failures. The method combines two well-characterized genetic tools: a conditional centromere that transiently blocks disjunction of one specific chromosome, and a duplication marker assay that identifies disomes among daughter cells. To test the strategy, we targeted chromosomes III, IV, and VI for duplication. RESULTS: The centromere of each chromosome was replaced by a centromere that can be blocked by growth in galactose, and ura3::HIS3, a duplication marker. Transient exposure to galactose induced the appearance of colonies carrying duplicated markers for chromosomes III or IV, but not VI. Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) confirmed that disomic strains carrying extra chromosome III or IV were generated. Chromosome VI contains several genes that are known to be deleterious when overexpressed, including the beta-tubulin gene TUB2. To test whether a tubulin stoichiometry imbalance is necessary for the apparent lethality caused by an extra chromosome VI, we supplied the parent strain with extra copies of the alpha-tubulin gene TUB1, then induced nondisjunction. Galactose-dependent chromosome VI disomes were produced, as revealed by CGH. Some chromosome VI disomes also carried extra, unselected copies of additional chromosomes. CONCLUSION: This method causes efficient nondisjunction of a targeted chromosome and allows resulting disomic cells to be identified and maintained. We used the method to test the role of tubulin imbalance in the apparent lethality of disomic chromosome VI. Our results indicate that a tubulin imbalance is necessary for disomic VI lethality, but it may not be the only dosage-dependent effect.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins play causative roles in many human diseases. Their overexpression is toxic in many organisms, but the causes of toxicity are opaque. In this paper, we exploit yeast technologies to determine the root of toxicity for one such protein, the yeast prion Rnq1. This protein is profoundly toxic when overexpressed but only in cells carrying the endogenous Rnq1 protein in its [RNQ(+)] prion (amyloid) conformation. Surprisingly, toxicity was not caused by general proteotoxic stress. Rather, it involved a highly specific mitotic arrest mediated by the Mad2 cell cycle checkpoint. Monopolar spindles accumulated as a result of defective duplication of the yeast centrosome (spindle pole body [SPB]). This arose from selective Rnq1-mediated sequestration of the core SPB component Spc42 in the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD). Rnq1 does not normally participate in spindle pole dynamics, but it does assemble at the IPOD when aggregated. Our work illustrates how the promiscuous interactions of an intrinsically disordered protein can produce highly specific cellular toxicities through illicit, yet highly specific, interactions with the proteome.},

Large-scale genetic network analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a powerful perspective for addressing these questions through quantitative measurements of genetic interactions between pairs of duplicated genes, and more generally, through the study of genome-wide genetic interaction profiles associated with duplicated genes. We show that duplicate genes exhibit fewer genetic interactions than other genes because they tend to buffer one another functionally, whereas observed interactions are non-overlapping and reflect their divergent roles. We also show that duplicate gene pairs are highly imbalanced in their number of genetic interactions with other genes, a pattern that appears to result from asymmetric evolution, such that one duplicate evolves or degrades faster than the other and often becomes functionally or conditionally specialized. The differences in genetic interactions are predictive of differences in several other evolutionary and physiological properties of duplicate pairs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The increasing availability of gene expression microarray technology has resulted in the publication of thousands of microarray gene expression datasets investigating various biological conditions. This vast repository is still underutilized due to the lack of methods for fast, accurate exploration of the entire compendium. RESULTS: We have collected Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression microarray data containing roughly 2400 experimental conditions. We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset's relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273{\%} compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology. Further, we find that our search paradigm identifies novel biological predictions that can be verified through further experimentation. Our methodology provides the ability for biological researchers to explore the totality of existing microarray data in a manner useful for drawing conclusions and formulating hypotheses, which we believe is invaluable for the research community.

To address this problem, we developed "reference-assisted chromosome assembly" (RACA), an algorithm to reliably order and orient sequence scaffolds generated by NGS and assemblers into longer chromosomal fragments using comparative genome information and paired-end reads. Evaluation of results using simulated and real genome assemblies indicates that our approach can substantially improve genomes generated by a wide variety of de novo assemblers if a good reference assembly of a closely related species and outgroup genomes are available. We used RACA to reconstruct 60 Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) chromosome fragments from 1,434 SOAPdenovo sequence scaffolds, of which 16 chromosome fragments were homologous to complete cattle chromosomes. Experimental validation by PCR showed that predictions made by RACA are highly accurate. Our results indicate that RACA will significantly facilitate the study of chromosome evolution and genome rearrangements for the large number of genomes being sequenced by NGS that do not have a genetic or physical map.},

abstract = {Two protein-based genetic elements (prions) have been identified in yeast. It is not clear whether other prions exist, nor is it understood how one might find them. We established criteria for searching protein databases for prion candidates and found several. The first examined, Rnq1, exists in distinct, heritable physical states, soluble and insoluble. The insoluble state is dominant and transmitted between cells through the cytoplasm. When the prion-like region of Rnq1 was substituted for the prion domain of Sup35, the protein determinant of the prion [PSI+], the phenotypic and epigenetic behavior of [PSI+] was fully recapitulated. These findings identify Rnq1 as a prion, demonstrate that prion domains are modular and transferable, and establish a paradigm for identifying and characterizing novel prions.},

abstract = {Termination and ribosome recycling are essential processes in translation. In eukaryotes, a stop codon in the ribosomal A site is decoded by a ternary complex consisting of release factors eRF1 and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound eRF3. After GTP hydrolysis, eRF3 dissociates, and ABCE1 can bind to eRF1-loaded ribosomes to stimulate peptide release and ribosomal subunit dissociation. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of a pretermination complex containing eRF1-eRF3 and a termination/prerecycling complex containing eRF1-ABCE1. eRF1 undergoes drastic conformational changes: its central domain harboring the catalytically important GGQ loop is either packed against eRF3 or swung toward the peptidyl transferase center when bound to ABCE1. Additionally, in complex with eRF3, the N-terminal domain of eRF1 positions the conserved NIKS motif proximal to the stop codon, supporting its suggested role in decoding, yet it appears to be delocalized in the presence of ABCE1. These results suggest that stop codon decoding and peptide release can be uncoupled during termination.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces bayanus is a yeast species described as one of the two parents of the hybrid brewing yeast S. pastorianus. Strains CBS380(T) and NBRC1948 have been retained successively as pure-line representatives of S. bayanus. In the present study, sequence analyses confirmed and upgraded our previous finding: S. bayanus type strain CBS380(T) harbours a mosaic genome. The genome of strain NBRC1948 was also revealed to be mosaic. Both genomes were characterized by amplification and sequencing of different markers, including genes involved in maltotriose utilization or genes detected by array-CGH mapping. Sequence comparisons with public Saccharomyces spp. nucleotide sequences revealed that the CBS380(T) and NBRC1948 genomes are composed of: a predominant non-cerevisiae genetic background belonging to S. uvarum, a second unidentified species provisionally named S. lagerae, and several introgressed S. cerevisiae fragments. The largest cerevisiae-introgressed DNA common to both genomes totals 70kb in length and is distributed in three contigs, cA, cB and cC. These vary in terms of length and presence of MAL31 or MTY1 (maltotriose-transporter gene). In NBRC1948, two additional cerevisiae-contigs, cD and cE, totaling 12kb in length, as well as several smaller cerevisiae fragments were identified. All of these contigs were partially detected in the genomes of S. pastorianus lager strains CBS1503 (S. monacensis) and CBS1513 (S. carlsbergensis) explaining the noticeable common ability of S. bayanus and S. pastorianus to metabolize maltotriose. NBRC1948 was shown to be inter-fertile with S. uvarum CBS7001. The cross involving these two strains produced F1 segregants resembling the strains CBS380(T) or NRRLY-1551. This demonstrates that these S. bayanus strains were the offspring of a cross between S. uvarum and a strain similar to NBRC1948. Phylogenies established with selected cerevisiae and non-cerevisiae genes allowed us to decipher the complex hybridisation events linking S. lagerae/S. uvarum/S. cerevisiae with their hybrid species, S. bayanus/pastorianus.},

@article{Kroll2013,
abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to reproductive isolation is essential for understanding population structure and speciation. While several models have been advanced to explain post-mating reproductive isolation, experimental data supporting most are indirect. Laboratory investigations of this phenomenon are typically carried out under benign conditions, which result in low rates of genetic change unlikely to initiate reproductive isolation. Previously, we described an experimental system using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where starvation served as a proxy to any stress that decreases reproduction and/or survivorship. We showed that novel lineages with restructured genomes quickly emerged in starved populations, and that these survivors were more fit than their ancestors when re-starved. Here we show that certain yeast lineages that survive starvation have become reproductively isolated from their ancestor. We further demonstrate that reproductive isolation arises from genomic rearrangements, whose frequency in starving yeast is several orders of magnitude greater than an unstarved control. By contrast, the frequency of point mutations is less than 2-fold greater. In a particular case, we observe that a starved lineage becomes reproductively isolated as a direct result of the stress-related accumulation of a single chromosome. We recapitulate this result by demonstrating that introducing an extra copy of one or several chromosomes into na{\"{\i}}ve, i.e. unstarved, yeast significantly diminishes their fertility. This type of reproductive barrier, whether arising spontaneously or via genetic manipulation, can be removed by making a lineage euploid for the altered chromosomes. Our model provides direct genetic evidence that reproductive isolation can arise frequently in stressed populations via genome restructuring without the precondition of geographic isolation.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing, particularly in fungi, has progressed at a tremendous rate. More difficult, however, is experimental testing of the inferences about gene function that can be drawn from comparative sequence analysis alone. We present a genome-wide functional characterization of a sequenced but experimentally understudied budding yeast, Saccharomyces bayanus var. uvarum (henceforth referred to as S. bayanus), allowing us to map changes over the 20 million years that separate this organism from S. cerevisiae. We first created a suite of genetic tools to facilitate work in S. bayanus. Next, we measured the gene-expression response of S. bayanus to a diverse set of perturbations optimized using a computational approach to cover a diverse array of functionally relevant biological responses. The resulting data set reveals that gene-expression patterns are largely conserved, but significant changes may exist in regulatory networks such as carbohydrate utilization and meiosis. In addition to regulatory changes, our approach identified gene functions that have diverged. The functions of genes in core pathways are highly conserved, but we observed many changes in which genes are involved in osmotic stress, peroxisome biogenesis, and autophagy. A surprising number of genes specific to S. bayanus respond to oxidative stress, suggesting the organism may have evolved under different selection pressures than S. cerevisiae. This work expands the scope of genome-scale evolutionary studies from sequence-based analysis to rapid experimental characterization and could be adopted for functional mapping in any lineage of interest. Furthermore, our detailed characterization of S. bayanus provides a valuable resource for comparative functional genomics studies in yeast.},

To investigate the contribution of splicing to ribosome production and function, we systematically eliminated introns from all RP genes to evaluate their impact on RNA expression, pre-rRNA processing, cell growth, and response to stress. The majority of introns were required for optimal cell fitness or growth under stress. Most introns are found in duplicated RP genes, and surprisingly, in the majority of cases, deleting the intron from one gene copy affected the expression of the other in a nonreciprocal manner. Consistently, 70{\%} of all duplicated genes were asymmetrically expressed, and both introns and gene deletions displayed copy-specific phenotypic effects. Together, our results indicate that splicing in yeast RP genes mediates intergene regulation and implicate the expression ratio of duplicated RP genes in modulating ribosome function.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal behavior of chromosomes and their regulatory proteins is a key control mechanism in genomic function. This is exemplified by the clustering of the 32 budding yeast telomeres that form foci in which silencing factors concentrate. To uncover the determinants of telomere distribution, we compare live-cell imaging with a stochastic model of telomere dynamics that we developed. We show that random encounters alone are inadequate to produce the clustering observed in vivo. In contrast, telomere dynamics observed in vivo in both haploid and diploid cells follows a process of dissociation-aggregation. We determine the time that two telomeres spend in the same cluster for the telomere distribution observed in cells expressing different levels of the silencing factor Sir3 protein, limiting for telomere clustering. We conclude that telomere clusters, their dynamics, and their nuclear distribution result from random motion, aggregation, and dissociation of telomeric regions, specifically determined by the amount of Sir3.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the absence of internal membranes, the nucleus of eukaryotic cells is spatially organized, with chromosomes and individual loci occupying dynamic, but nonrandom, spatial positions relative to nuclear landmarks and to each other. These positional preferences correlate with gene expression and DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Yet the principles that govern nuclear organization remain poorly understood and detailed predictive models are lacking.

RESULTS: We present a computational model of dynamic chromosome configurations in the interphase yeast nucleus that is based on first principles and is able to statistically predict the positioning of any locus in nuclear space. Despite its simplicity, the model agrees with extensive previous and new measurements on locus positioning and with genome-wide DNA contact frequencies. Notably, our model recapitulates the position and morphology of the nucleolus, the observed variations in locus positions, and variations in contact frequencies within and across chromosomes, as well as subchromosomal contact features. The model is also able to correctly predict nuclear reorganization accompanying a reduction in ribosomal DNA transcription, and sites of chromosomal rearrangements tend to occur where the model predicted high contact frequencies.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that large-scale yeast nuclear architecture can be largely understood as a consequence of generic properties of crowded polymers rather than of specific DNA-binding factors and that configurations of chromosomes and DNA contacts are dictated mainly by genomic location and chromosome lengths. Our model provides a quantitative framework to understand and predict large-scale spatial genome organization and its interplay with functional processes.},

abstract = {Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

abstract = {Multiple prion elements, which are transmitted as heritable protein conformations and often linked to distinct phenotypes, have been identified in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been shown that overproduction of a prion protein Swi1 can promote the de novo conversion of another yeast prion [PSI(+)] when Sup35 is co-overproduced. However, the mechanism underlying this Pin(+) ([PSI(+)] inducible) activity is not clear. Moreover, how the Swi1 prion ([SWI(+)]) interacts with other yeast prions is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Pin(+) activity associated with Swi1 overproduction is independent of Rnq1 expression or [PIN(+)] conversion. We also show that [SWI(+)] enhances the appearance of [PSI(+)] and [PIN(+)]. However, [SWI(+)] significantly compromises the Pin(+) activity of [PIN(+)] when they coexist. We further demonstrate that a single yeast cell can harbor three prions, [PSI(+)], [PIN(+)], and [SWI(+)], simultaneously. However, under this condition, [SWI(+)] is significantly destabilized. While the propensity to aggregate underlies prionogenesis, Swi1 and Rnq1 aggregates resulting from overproduction are usually nonheritable. Conversely, prion protein aggregates formed in nonoverexpressing conditions or induced by preexisting prion(s) are more prionogenic. For [PSI(+)] and [PIN(+)] de novo formation, heterologous "facilitators," such as preexisting [SWI(+)] aggregates, colocalize only with the newly formed ring-/rod-shaped Sup35 or Rnq1 aggregates, but not with the dot-shaped mature prion aggregates. Their colocalization frequency is coordinated with their prion inducibility, indicating that prion-prion interactions mainly occur at the early initiation stage. Our results provide supportive evidence for the cross-seeding model of prionogenesis and highlight a complex interaction network among prions in yeast.},

abstract = {Yeast RAD2, a yeast homolog of human XPG gene, is an essential element of nucleotide excision repair (NER), and its deletion confers UV sensitivity and NER deficiency. 6-Azauracil (6AU) sensitivity of certain rad2 mutants revealed that RAD2 has transcription elongation function. However, the fundamental me- chanism by which the rad2 mutations confer 6AU sensitivity was not clearly elucidated yet. Using an insertional mutagenesis, PUF4 gene encoding a yeast pumilio protein was identified as a deletion suppressor of rad2∆ 6AU sensitivity. Microarray analysis followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR disclosed that RAD2 and PUF4 regulated expression of HPT1 and URA3. Overexpression of HPT1 and URA3 rescued the 6AU sensitivity of rad2∆ and puf4∆ mutants. These results indicate that 6AU sensitivity of rad2 mutants is in part ascribed to impaired expression regulation of genes in the nucleotide metabolism. Based on the results, the possible connection bet- ween impaired transcription elongation function of RAD2/XPG and Cockayne syndrome via PUF4 is discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) with different colors would be very useful for simultaneous comparisons of multiple protein fates, developmental lineages and gene expression levels. The simplest way to shift the emission color of GFP is to substitute histidine or tryptophan for the tyrosine in the chromophore, but such blue-shifted point mutants are only dimly fluorescent. The longest wavelengths previously reported for the excitation and emission peaks of GFP mutants are 488 and 511 nm, respectively. Results Additional substitutions, mainly in residues 145–163, have improved the brightness of the blue-shifted GFP mutants with histidine and tryptophan in place of tyrosine 66. Separate mutations have pushed the excitation and emission peaks of the most red-shifted mutant to 504 and 514 nm, respectively. At least three different colors of GFP mutants can now be cleanly distinguished from each other under the microscope, using appropriate filter sets. A fusion protein consisting of linked blue- and green-fluorescent proteins exhibits fluorescence resonance energy transfer, which is disrupted by proteolytic cleavage of the linker between the two domains. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that the production of more and better GFP variants is possible and worthwhile. The production of such variants facilitates multicolor imaging of differential gene expression, protein localization or cell fate. Fusions between mutants of different colors may be useful substrates for the continuous in situ assay of proteases. Demonstration of energy transfer between GFP variants is an important step towards a general method for monitoring the mutual association of fusion proteins.},

abstract = {The synthesis of biotin, a vitamin required for many carboxylation reactions, is a variable trait in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many S. cerevisiae strains, including common laboratory strains, contain only a partial biotin synthesis pathway. We here report the identification of the first step necessary for the biotin synthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae. The biotin auxotroph strain S288c was able to grow on media lacking biotin when BIO1 and the known biotin synthesis gene BIO6 were introduced together on a plasmid vector. BIO1 is a paralog of YJR154W, a gene of unknown function and adjacent to BIO6. The nature of BIO1 illuminates the remarkable evolutionary history of the biotin biosynthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae. This pathway appears to have been lost in an ancestor of S. cerevisiae and subsequently rebuilt by a combination of horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization. Unusually, for S. cerevisiae, most of the genes required for biotin synthesis in S. cerevisiae are grouped in two subtelomeric gene clusters. The BIO1-BIO6 functional cluster is an example of a cluster of genes of "dispensable function," one of the few categories of genes in S. cerevisiae that are positionally clustered.},

Knowledge of pigment pattern development comes from a variety of systems, including avians, mouse, and more recently, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Recent analyses of the mechanisms underlying the development of the neural crest-derived pigment cell type common to all vertebrates, the melanocyte, have revealed remarkable similarities and several surprising differences between amniotes and zebrafish. Here, we summarize recent advances in the study of melanocyte development in zebrafish, with reference to human, mouse, and avian systems. We first review melanocyte development in zebrafish and mammals, followed by a summary of the molecules known to be required for their development. We then discuss several relatively unaddressed issues in vertebrate pigment pattern development that are being investigated in zebrafish. These include determining the relationships between genetically distinct classes of melanocytes, characterizing and dissecting melanocyte stem cell development, and understanding how pigment cells organize into a patterned tissue. Further analysis of zebrafish pigment pattern mutants as well as new generations of directed mutant screens promise to extend our understanding of pigment pattern morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a jellyfish, Aequorea victoria, and its mutants are widely used in biomedical studies as fluorescent markers. In spite of the enormous efforts of academia and industry toward generating its red fluorescent mutants, no GFP variants with emission maximum at more than 529 nm have been developed during the 15 years since its cloning. Here, we used a new strategy of molecular evolution aimed at generating a red-emitting mutant of GFP. As a result, we have succeeded in producing the first GFP mutant that substantially matures to the red-emitting state with excitation and emission maxima at 555 and 585 nm, respectively. A novel, nonoxidative mechanism for formation of the red chromophore in this mutant that includes a dehydration of the Ser65 side chain has been proposed. Model experiments showed that the novel dual-color GFP mutant with green and red emission is suitable for multicolor flow cytometry as an additional color since it is clearly separable from both green and red fluorescent tags.},

@article{Chen2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: When compared to Sanger sequencing technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are hindered by shorter sequence read length, higher base-call error rate, non-uniform coverage, and platform-specific sequencing artifacts. These characteristics lower the quality of their downstream analyses, e.g. de novo and reference-based assembly, by introducing sequencing artifacts and errors that may contribute to incorrect interpretation of data. Although many tools have been developed for quality control and pre-processing of NGS data, none of them provide flexible and comprehensive trimming options in conjunction with parallel processing to expedite pre-processing of large NGS datasets.

METHODS: We developed ngsShoRT (next-generation sequencing Short Reads Trimmer), a flexible and comprehensive open-source software package written in Perl that provides a set of algorithms commonly used for pre-processing NGS short read sequences. We compared the features and performance of ngsShoRT with existing tools: CutAdapt, NGS QC Toolkit and Trimmomatic. We also compared the effects of using pre-processed short read sequences generated by different algorithms on de novo and reference-based assembly for three different genomes: Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, and Escherichia coli O157 H7.

RESULTS: Several combinations of ngsShoRT algorithms were tested on publicly available Illumina GA II, HiSeq 2000, and MiSeq eukaryotic and bacteria genomic short read sequences with the focus on removing sequencing artifacts and low-quality reads and/or bases. Our results show that across three organisms and three sequencing platforms, trimming improved the mean quality scores of trimmed sequences. Using trimmed sequences for de novo and reference-based assembly improved assembly quality as well as assembler performance. In general, ngsShoRT outperformed comparable trimming tools in terms of trimming speed and improvement of de novo and reference-based assembly as measured by assembly contiguity and correctness.

CONCLUSIONS: Trimming of short read sequences can improve the quality of de novo and reference-based assembly and assembler performance. The parallel processing capability of ngsShoRT reduces trimming time and improves the memory efficiency when dealing with large datasets. We recommend combining sequencing artifacts removal, and quality score based read filtering and base trimming as the most consistent method for improving sequence quality and downstream assemblies. ngsShoRT source code, user guide and tutorial are available at http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/genomics/ngsShoRT/. ngsShoRT can be incorporated as a pre-processing step in genome and transcriptome assembly projects.},

Since there is no reference genome available, de novo assembly methods play key roles in the analysis of these data sets. Because of the huge amount of data generated by NGS technologies for each run, many assemblers, e.g., ABySS, Velvet and Trinity, are developed based on a de Bruijn graph due to its time- and space-efficiency. However, most of these assemblers were developed initially for the Illumina/Solexa platform. The performance of these assemblers on 454 transcriptomic data is unknown. In this study, we evaluated and compared the relative performance of these de Bruijn graph based assemblers on both simulated and real 454 transcriptomic data. The results suggest that Trinity, the Illumina/Solexa-specialized transcriptomic assembler, performs the best among the multiple de Bruijn graph assemblers, comparable to or even outperforming the standard 454 assembler Newbler which is based on the overlap-layout-consensus algorithm. Our evaluation is expected to provide helpful guidance for researchers to choose assemblers when analyzing 454 transcriptomic data.},

abstract = {The quest for genes representing genetic relationships of strains or individuals within populations and their evolutionary history is acquiring a novel dimension of complexity with the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In fact, sequencing an entire genome uncovers genetic variation in coding and non-coding regions and offers the possibility of studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations at the strain level. Nevertheless, the disadvantageous cost-benefit ratio (the amount of details disclosed by NGS against the time-expensive and expertise-demanding data assembly process) still precludes the application of these techniques to the routinely assignment of yeast strains, making the selection of the most reliable molecular markers greatly desirable. In this work we propose an original computational approach to discover genes that can be used as a descriptor of the population structure. We found 13 genes whose variability can be used to recapitulate the phylogeny obtained from genome-wide sequences. The same approach that we prove to be successful in yeasts can be generalized to any other population of individuals given the availability of high-quality genomic sequences and of a clear population structure to be targeted.},

abstract = {Cell size increases significantly with increasing ploidy. Differences in cell size and ploidy are associated with alterations in gene expression, although no direct connection has been made between cell size and transcription. Here we show that ploidy-associated changes in gene expression reflect transcriptional adjustment to a larger cell size, implicating cellular geometry as a key parameter in gene regulation. Using RNA-seq, we identified genes whose expression was altered in a tetraploid as compared with the isogenic haploid. A significant fraction of these genes encode cell surface proteins, suggesting an effect of the enlarged cell size on the differential regulation of these genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of these genes in haploid mutants that also produce enlarged size. Surprisingly, many genes differentially regulated in the tetraploid are identically regulated in the enlarged haploids, and the magnitude of change in gene expression correlates with the degree of size enlargement. These results indicate a causal relationship between cell size and transcription, with a size-sensing mechanism that alters transcription in response to size. The genes responding to cell size are enriched for those regulated by two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and components in those pathways were found to mediate size-dependent gene regulation. Transcriptional adjustment to enlarged cell size could underlie other cellular changes associated with polyploidy. The causal relationship between cell size and transcription suggests that cell size homeostasis serves a regulatory role in transcriptome maintenance.},

abstract = {We sequenced the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YJM789, which was derived from a yeast isolated from the lung of an AIDS patient with pneumonia. The strain is used for studies of fungal infections and quantitative genetics because of its extensive phenotypic differences to the laboratory reference strain, including growth at high temperature and deadly virulence in mouse models. Here we show that the approximately 12-Mb genome of YJM789 contains approximately 60,000 SNPs and approximately 6,000 indels with respect to the reference S288c genome, leading to protein polymorphisms with a few known cases of phenotypic changes. Several ORFs are found to be unique to YJM789, some of which might have been acquired through horizontal transfer. Localized regions of high polymorphism density are scattered over the genome, in some cases spanning multiple ORFs and in others concentrated within single genes. The sequence of YJM789 contains clues to pathogenicity and spurs the development of more powerful approaches to dissecting the genetic basis of complex hereditary traits.},

abstract = {We have used three independent phylogenomic approaches (concatenated alignments, single-, and multi-gene supertrees) to reconstruct the fungal tree of life (FTOL) using publicly available fungal genomes. This is the first time multi-gene families have been used in fungal supertree reconstruction and permits us to use up to 66{\%} of the 1,001,217 genes in our fungal database. Our analyses show that different phylogenomic datasets derived from varying clustering criteria and alignment orientation do not have a major effect on phylogenomic supertree reconstruction. Overall the resultant phylogenomic trees are relatively congruent with one another and successfully recover the major fungal phyla, subphyla and classes. We find that where incongruences do occur, the inferences are usually poorly supported. Within the Ascomycota phylum, our phylogenies reconstruct monophyletic Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina subphyla clades and infer a sister group relationship between these to the exclusion of the Taphrinomycotina. Within the Pezizomycotina subphylum, all three phylogenies infer a sister group relationship between the Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes classes. However, there is conflict regarding the relationships with the Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes classes. Within the Basidiomycota phylum, supertrees derived from single- and multi-gene families infer a sister group relationship between the Pucciniomycotina and Agaricomycotina subphyla while the concatenated phylogeny infers a poorly supported relationship between the Agaricomycotina and Ustilagomycotina. The reconstruction of a robust FTOL is important for future fungal comparative analyses. We illustrate this point by performing a preliminary investigation into the phyletic distribution of yeast prion-like proteins in the fungal kingdom.},

abstract = {Colour patterns of adult fish are composed of several different types of pigment cells distributing in the skin during juvenile development. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, displays a striking pattern of dark stripes of melanophores interspersed with light stripes of xanthophores. A third cell type, silvery iridophores, contributes to both stripes and plays a crucial role in adult pigment pattern formation. Several mutants deficient in iridophore development display similar adult phenotypes with reduced numbers of melanophores and defects in stripe formation. This indicates a supporting role of iridophores for melanophore development and maintenance. One of these mutants, rose (rse), encodes the Endothelin receptor b1a. Here we describe a new mutant in zebrafish, karneol (kar), which has a phenotype similar to weak alleles of rse with a reduction in iridophore numbers and defects of adult pigment patterning. We show that, unlike rse, kar is not required in iridophores. The gene defective in the kar mutant codes for an endothelin-converting enzyme, Ece2, which activates endothelin ligands by proteolytic cleavage. By morpholino-mediated knockdown, we identify Endothelin 3b (Edn3b) as the ligand for endothelin receptor signalling in larval iridophores. Thus, Endothelin signalling is involved in iridophore development, proliferation and stripe morphogenesis in larvae as well as adult zebrafish. In mammals the pathway is required for melanocyte development; therefore, our results indicate a previously unrecognized close evolutionary relationship between iridophores in zebrafish and melanocytes in mammals.},

Polyamine sensitivity, which has been observed for a certain gap junction in vitro, confers rectification property to gap junction. Here we report that the polyamine sensitivity of gap junctions in vivo is crucial for skin pattern formation in zebrafish. Transgenic experiments have revealed that several connexin genes were able to rescue the spot phenotype of mutant zebrafish. Mutational analyses of the N-terminal region of connexins revealed that the ExxxE motif, a hypothetical polyamine-binding site, was important for connexin's role in pattern formation. Ectopic expression of spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT), a polyamine metabolic enzyme, also caused stripe pattern changes, which further indicates that the polyamine sensitivity of gap junctions is crucial. This is the first report to show that polyamine sensitivity has a physiologically relevant function and is related to skin pattern formation in animals.},

abstract = {Marine animals, especially those from tropical waters, are often brilliantly coloured, and bright colouration is widespread in both sessile and non-sessile invertebrates. These spectacular natural colours are common in species inhabiting shallow waters, and appear not only in animals exposed to bright light, but also in those living in dark areas where colours are visible only with artificial illumination. Marine organisms also show variation in colour with depth and geographical location, and display great variety in colour patterning. These colour characteristics are the result of several different processes, and serve various purposes - the distribution and function of pigments seems to vary between invertebrate groups. In addition to playing an important role in how marine organisms interact, pigments may be involved in physiological processes. Although nitrogenous pigments predominate, marine organisms contain pigments belonging to all the major structural classes of natural products, as well as some that are unique to the marine environment. This review discusses the nature and significance of such pigments, the chemical and biological processes involved, the factors responsible for and affecting bright colourations, as well as their evolution and speculation as to their function.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which animal markings are formed is an intriguing problem that has remained unsolved for a long time. One of the most important questions is whether the positional information for the pattern formation is derived from a covert prepattern or an autonomous mechanism. In this study, using the zebrafish as the model system, we attempted to answer this classic question. We ablated the pigment cells in limited areas of zebrafish skin by using laser irradiation, and we observed the regeneration of the pigmentation pattern. Depending on the area ablated, different patterns regenerated in a specific time course. The regenerated patterns and the transition of the stripes during the regeneration process suggest that pattern formation is independent of the prepattern; furthermore, pattern formation occurs by an autonomous mechanism that satisfies the condition of "local self-enhancement and long-range inhibition." Because the zebrafish is the only striped animal for which detailed molecular genetic studies have been conducted, our finding will facilitate the identification of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie skin pattern formation.},

Budding and fission yeast are therefore attractive organisms in which to study dynamic cellular processes such as growth, cell division, and morphogenesis using live cell fluorescence microscopy. This article focuses on methods to culture, mount, and observe budding yeast cells using three-dimensional (3D) microscopy, but the methods are broadly applicable to other types of cells and other imaging techniques. The emphasis is on 3D imaging, because yeast cells are roughly spherical, and most organelles in yeast move in three dimensions. Three-dimensional imaging also makes it possible to apply image restoration methods (e.g., deconvolution) to obtain sharper images with better definition. This is important, because yeast cells are small (haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have a diameter of {\~{}}4-5 µm) relative to the resolution of even the best optical microscope ({\~{}}0.25 µm).},

abstract = {Circadian timing is a fundamental biological process, underlying cellular physiology in animals, plants, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Circadian clocks organize gene expression, metabolism, and behavior such that they occur at specific times of day. The biological clocks that orchestrate these daily changes confer a survival advantage and dominate daily behavior, for example, waking us in the morning and helping us to sleep at night. The molecular mechanism of circadian clocks has been sketched out in genetic model systems from prokaryotes to humans, revealing a combination of transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways, but the clock mechanism is far from solved. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is among the most powerful genetic experimental systems and, as such, could greatly contribute to our understanding of cellular timing, it still remains absent from the repertoire of circadian model organisms. Here, we use continuous cultures of yeast, establishing conditions that reveal characteristic clock properties similar to those described in other species. Our results show that metabolism in yeast shows systematic circadian entrainment, responding to cycle length and zeitgeber (stimulus) strength, and a (heavily damped) free running rhythm. Furthermore, the clock is obvious in a standard, haploid, auxotrophic strain, opening the door for rapid progress into cellular clock mechanisms.},

abstract = {Interactions among genes and the environment are a common source of phenotypic variation. To characterize the interplay between genetics and the environment at single nucleotide resolution, we quantified the genetic and environmental interactions of four quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) that govern yeast sporulation efficiency. We first constructed a panel of strains that together carry all 32 possible combinations of the 4 QTN genotypes in 2 distinct genetic backgrounds. We then measured the sporulation efficiencies of these 32 strains across 8 controlled environments. This dataset shows that variation in sporulation efficiency is shaped largely by genetic and environmental interactions. We find clear examples of QTN:environment, QTN: background, and environment:background interactions. However, we find no QTN:QTN interactions that occur consistently across the entire dataset. Instead, interactions between QTN only occur under specific combinations of environment and genetic background. Thus, what might appear to be a QTN:QTN interaction in one background and environment becomes a more complex QTN:QTN:environment:background interaction when we consider the entire dataset as a whole. As a result, the phenotypic impact of a set of QTN alleles cannot be predicted from genotype alone. Our results instead demonstrate that the effects of QTN and their interactions are inextricably linked both to genetic background and to environmental variation.},

abstract = {Antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), or genetic tradeoff, is an important concept that is frequently invoked in theories of aging, cancer, genetic disease, and other common phenomena. However, the prevalence of AP, which genes are subject to AP, and to what extent and how AP may be resolved remain unclear. By measuring the fitness difference between the wild-type and null alleles of {\~{}}5,000 nonessential genes in yeast, we found that in any given environment, yeast expresses hundreds of genes that harm rather than benefit the organism, demonstrating widespread AP. Nonetheless, under sufficient selection, AP is often resolvable through regulatory evolution, primarily by trans-acting changes, although in one case we also detected a cis-acting change and localized its causal mutation. However, AP is resolved more slowly in smaller populations, predicting more unresolved AP in multicellular organisms than in yeast. These findings provide an empirical foundation for AP-dependent theories and have broad biomedical and evolutionary implications.},

Only the study of meiotic bivalents and the synaptonemal complex and the visualization of chromosome-sized DNA molecules on pulsed-field gels have provided some insight into chromosome structure and behavior. More recently, advanced techniques such as in situ hybridization, the illumination of chromosomal loci by GFP-tagged DNA-binding proteins, and immunostaining of chromosomal proteins have promoted our knowledge about yeast chromosomes. These novel cytological approaches in combination with the yeast's advanced biochemistry and genetics have produced a great wealth of information on the interplay between molecular and cytological processes and have strengthened the role of yeast as a leading cell biological model organism. Recent cytological studies have revealed much about the chromosomal organization in interphase nuclei and have contributed significantly to our current understanding of chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion, and centromere orientation in mitosis. Moreover, important details about the biochemistry and ultrastructure of meiotic pairing and recombination have been revealed by combined cytological and molecular approaches. This article covers several aspects of yeast chromosome structure, including their organization within interphase nuclei and their behavior during mitosis and meiosis.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 59 of the 78 ribosomal proteins are encoded by duplicated genes that, in most cases, encode identical or very similar protein products. However, different sets of ribosomal protein genes have been identified in screens for various phenotypes, including life span, budding pattern, and drug sensitivities. Due to potential suppressors of growth rate defects among this set of strains in the ORF deletion collection, we regenerated the entire set of haploid ribosomal protein gene deletion strains in a clean genetic background. The new strains were used to create double deletions lacking both paralogs, allowing us to define a set of 14 nonessential ribosomal proteins. Replicative life-span analysis of new strains corresponding to ORF deletion collection strains that likely carried suppressors of growth defects identified 11 new yeast replicative aging genes. Treatment of the collection of ribosomal protein gene deletion strains with tunicamycin revealed a significant correlation between slow growth and resistance to ER stress that was recapitulated by reducing translation of wild-type yeast with cycloheximide. Interestingly, enhanced tunicamycin resistance in ribosomal protein gene deletion mutants was independent of the unfolded protein response transcription factor Hac1. These data support a model in which reduced translation is protective against ER stress by a mechanism distinct from the canonical ER stress response pathway and further add to the diverse yet specific phenotypes associated with ribosomal protein gene deletions.},

@article{Carlquist2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally average values of the whole population are considered when analysing microbial cell cultivations. However, a typical microbial population in a bioreactor is heterogeneous in most phenotypes measurable at a single-cell level. There are indications that such heterogeneity may be unfavourable on the one hand (reduces yields and productivities), but also beneficial on the other hand (facilitates quick adaptation to new conditions--i.e. increases the robustness of the fermentation process). Understanding and control of microbial population heterogeneity is thus of major importance for improving microbial cell factory processes.

RESULTS: In this work, a dual reporter system was developed and applied to map growth and cell fitness heterogeneities within budding yeast populations during aerobic cultivation in well-mixed bioreactors. The reporter strain, which was based on the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the ribosomal protein RPL22a promoter, made it possible to distinguish cell growth phases by the level of fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, by exploiting the strong correlation of intracellular GFP level and cell membrane integrity it was possible to distinguish subpopulations with high and low cell membrane robustness and hence ability to withstand freeze-thaw stress. A strong inverse correlation between growth and cell membrane robustness was observed, which further supports the hypothesis that cellular resources are limited and need to be distributed as a trade-off between two functions: growth and robustness. In addition, the trade-off was shown to vary within the population, and the occurrence of two distinct subpopulations shifting between these two antagonistic modes of cell operation could be distinguished.

CONCLUSIONS: The reporter strain enabled mapping of population heterogeneities in growth and cell membrane robustness towards freeze-thaw stress at different phases of cell cultivation. The described reporter system is a valuable tool for understanding the effect of environmental conditions on population heterogeneity of microbial cells and thereby to understand cell responses during industrial process-like conditions. It may be applied to identify more robust subpopulations, and for developing novel strategies for strain improvement and process design for more effective bioprocessing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need for rapid and efficient microbial cell factory design and construction are possible through the enabling technology, metabolic engineering, which is now being facilitated by systems biology approaches. Metabolic engineering is often complimented by directed evolution, where selective pressure is applied to a partially genetically engineered strain to confer a desirable phenotype. The exact genetic modification or resulting genotype that leads to the improved phenotype is often not identified or understood to enable further metabolic engineering.

RESULTS: In this work we performed whole genome high-throughput sequencing and annotation can be used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains S288c and CEN.PK113-7D. The yeast strain S288c was the first eukaryote sequenced, serving as the reference genome for the Saccharomyces Genome Database, while CEN.PK113-7D is a preferred laboratory strain for industrial biotechnology research. A total of 13,787 high-quality SNPs were detected between both strains (reference strain: S288c). Considering only metabolic genes (782 of 5,596 annotated genes), a total of 219 metabolism specific SNPs are distributed across 158 metabolic genes, with 85 of the SNPs being nonsynonymous (e.g., encoding amino acid modifications). Amongst metabolic SNPs detected, there was pathway enrichment in the galactose uptake pathway (GAL1, GAL10) and ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (ERG8, ERG9). Physiological characterization confirmed a strong deficiency in galactose uptake and metabolism in S288c compared to CEN.PK113-7D, and similarly, ergosterol content in CEN.PK113-7D was significantly higher in both glucose and galactose supplemented cultivations compared to S288c. Furthermore, DNA microarray profiling of S288c and CEN.PK113-7D in both glucose and galactose batch cultures did not provide a clear hypothesis for major phenotypes observed, suggesting that genotype to phenotype correlations are manifested post-transcriptionally or post-translationally either through protein concentration and/or function.

CONCLUSIONS: With an intensifying need for microbial cell factories that produce a wide array of target compounds, whole genome high-throughput sequencing and annotation for SNP detection can aid in better reducing and defining the metabolic landscape. This work demonstrates direct correlations between genotype and phenotype that provides clear and high-probability of success metabolic engineering targets.

abstract = {Deep sequencing now provides detailed snapshots of ribosome occupancy on mRNAs. We leverage these data to parameterize a computational model of translation, keeping track of every ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA molecule in a yeast cell. We determine the parameter regimes in which fast initiation or high codon bias in a transgene increases protein yield and infer the initiation rates of endogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, which vary by several orders of magnitude and correlate with 5' mRNA folding energies. Our model recapitulates the previously reported 5'-to-3' ramp of decreasing ribosome densities, although our analysis shows that this ramp is caused by rapid initiation of short genes rather than slow codons at the start of transcripts. We conclude that protein production in healthy yeast cells is typically limited by the availability of free ribosomes, whereas protein production under periods of stress can sometimes be rescued by reducing initiation or elongation rates.},

Results
Initiation-limited regime
Simulated 1500s of translation. 1300s computational time.
Transgene expression and codon bias. For abundant transcripts increasing CAI is very efficient (50{\%} leads to 3.6x per mRNA molecule); for minor transcripts the effect is much lower. It might explain the difference between transgene expression studies (successful) and evolutionary studies (unsuccessful). Free ribosomes are the reason. Measured the same for three other transgenes with compositions and sequences very different from that for GFP. the same results. The same results regardless from the fact that transgenes were just added or added to expense of the endogenous transcriptome. 
Codon bias will significantly increase transgene yield only if the initiation probability of a transgene increases the average. 
Initiation probability: despite its importance, it is the only parameter in the model not measured directly. 4s (5th percentile) to 233s (95th percentile) with a median of 40s. 
+ 5{\&}{\#}039; mRNA structure systematically modulates initiation rates among the genome. 

        

        
Interestingly, a negative correlation between gene length and initiation probability was found. A mechanistic explanation for the greater density of ribosomes typically observed on short genes. (bkgnd: shorter genes are densely packed with ribosomes despite having higher CAI and presumably faster elongation). Why would short genes experience selection for fast initiation? housekeeping and RP genes. shorter 5{\&}{\#}039; UTRs; longer 3{\&}{\#}039; UTRs are correlated with higher initiation probability (probably that{\&}{\#}039;s reinitiation). 
Recapitulated the data showing so-called ribosomal ramp. provide an alternative explanation (initiation-driven): shorter genes have higher initiation rates and are disproportionally weighted by each codon position. 
Distinguish between initiation- and elongation-driven models: in the case of the former the difference would disappear upon randomizing probabilities of initiation whilw in the case of the latter it would disappear upon randomizing codons within the gene. Two kinds of permutation were tested, and both support the former. 
Comparison to other models. TASEP: assumes free supply of ribosomes, which is 2.5x the true (estimated) number. The they artificially increase the number of ribosomes, they recapitulate the same result. 
Pausing... unclear
Under stress. Eg amino acid starvation. Modeled by decreasing the amount of their charged tRNAs. Limitation in different amino acids results in different levels (25{\%} to 10x) decrease in trl rate. This is caused primarily by decrease in the pool of free ribosomes. 
But cells have mechanisms to cope with that. Modeled the response: decreased the number of ribosomes (mimics reduced RP gene expression) and/or reduced initiation probabilities for each gene by a fixed factor (mimics Gcn2 phosphorylation). mild starvation: decreasing these values is detrimental. Severe stress: decreasing one of these parameters can partly rescue protein production. Why? The cell becomes elongation limited instead of initiation limited, and thus, reducing the initiation rate increases the pool of free ribosomes and free tRNAs, especially the corresponding ones. Thus, Gcn2 phosphorylation may not only minimize resource waste as thought earlier but rescue trl. 

        

        
Discussion
Ignores the details of termination and trl errors.

To investigate the contribution of splicing to ribosome production and function, we systematically eliminated introns from all RP genes to evaluate their impact on RNA expression, pre-rRNA processing, cell growth, and response to stress. The majority of introns were required for optimal cell fitness or growth under stress. Most introns are found in duplicated RP genes, and surprisingly, in the majority of cases, deleting the intron from one gene copy affected the expression of the other in a nonreciprocal manner. Consistently, 70{\%} of all duplicated genes were asymmetrically expressed, and both introns and gene deletions displayed copy-specific phenotypic effects. Together, our results indicate that splicing in yeast RP genes mediates intergene regulation and implicate the expression ratio of duplicated RP genes in modulating ribosome function.},

abstract = {Tia1/Pub1 is a stress granule component carrying a Q/N-rich prion domain. We provide direct evidence that Tia1 forms a prion in yeast. Moreover, Tia1/Pub1 acts cooperatively with release factor Sup35/eRF3 to establish a two-protein self-propagating state. This two-protein prion driven by the Q/N-rich prion domains of Sup35 and Tia1/Pub1 can be visualized as distinctive line structures along tubulin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we find that tubulin-associated complex containing Pub1 and Sup35 oligomers normally exists in yeast, and its assembly depends on prion domains of Pub1 and Sup35. This Sup35/Pub1 complex, which also contains TUB1 mRNA and components of translation machinery, is important for the integrity of the tubulin cytoskeleton: PUB1 disruption and Sup35 depletion from the complex lead to cytoskeletal defects. We propose that the complex is implicated in protein synthesis at the site of microtubule assembly. Thus our study identifies the role for prion domains in the assembly of multiprotein complexes.},

Replicative aging is accompanied by a reduction in histone protein levels, and this is a cause of aging in budding yeast. Here we show that nucleosome occupancy decreased by 50{\%} across the whole genome during replicative aging using spike-in controlled micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by sequencing. Furthermore, nucleosomes became less well positioned or moved to sequences predicted to better accommodate histone octamers. The loss of histones during aging led to transcriptional induction of all yeast genes. Genes that are normally repressed by promoter nucleosomes were most induced, accompanied by preferential nucleosome loss from their promoters. We also found elevated levels of DNA strand breaks, mitochondrial DNA transfer to the nuclear genome, large-scale chromosomal alterations, translocations, and retrotransposition during aging.},

abstract = {Recent papers have provided insight into the cytoplasmic assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and its transport to the nucleus. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing its nuclear assembly, stability, degradation, and recycling. We demonstrate that the foot of RNA pol II is crucial for the assembly and stability of the complex, by ensuring the correct association of Rpb1 with Rpb6 and of the dimer Rpb4-Rpb7 (Rpb4/7). Mutations at the foot affect the assembly and stability of the enzyme, a defect that is offset by RPB6 overexpression, in coordination with Rpb1 degradation by an Asr1-independent mechanism. Correct assembly is a prerequisite for the proper maintenance of several transcription steps. In fact, assembly defects alter transcriptional activity and the amount of enzyme associated with the genes, affect C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation, interfere with the mRNA-capping machinery, and possibly increase the amount of stalled RNA pol II. In addition, our data show that TATA-binding protein (TBP) occupancy does not correlate with RNA pol II occupancy or transcriptional activity, suggesting a functional relationship between assembly, Mediator, and preinitiation complex (PIC) stability. Finally, our data help clarify the mechanisms governing the assembly and stability of RNA pol II.},

Most of the tools developed to address this problem are optimized to handle a single setup and do not work out of the box in other settings. We present gitter, an image analysis tool for robust and accurate processing of images from colony-based screens. gitter works by first finding the grid of colonies from a preprocessed image and then locating the bounds of each colony separately. We show that gitter produces comparable colony sizes to other tools in simple cases but outperforms them by being able to handle a wider variety of screens and more accurately quantify colony sizes from difficult images. gitter is freely available as an R package from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gitter under the LGPL.

Under favorable growth conditions, and in the absence of the macrolide rapamycin, TORC1 is active, and influences virtually all aspects of cell growth. Although two direct effectors of yeast TORC1 have been reported (Tap42, a regulator of PP2A phosphatases and Sch9, an AGC family kinase), the signaling pathways that couple TORC1 to its distal effectors were not well understood. To elucidate these pathways we developed and employed a quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry approach. Analyses of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteomes in various genetic backgrounds revealed both documented and novel TORC1 effectors and allowed us to partition phosphorylation events between Tap42 and Sch9. Follow-up detailed characterization shows that Sch9 regulates RNA polymerases I and III, the latter via Maf1, in addition to translation initiation and the expression of ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis genes. This demonstrates that Sch9 is a master regulator of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Iron deficiency is a common condition increasingly diagnosed and treated by gastroenterologists. The most common presentation of iron deficiency is anaemia; however, it is a systemic disorder affecting multiple aspects of health in various organs. Iron is an essential element, with iron-containing proteins exerting a variety of vital functions, including oxygen transport, cellular respiration, intermediary metabolism, regulation of transcription and DNA repair. Major pathways of iron utilisation and production of iron-containing proteins include iron sulphur cluster biosynthesis, haem synthesis and storage within ferritin. The main site of iron absorption is the small intestine, but most iron is recycled by the monocyte-macrophage system via phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes. Hepcidin, the key iron-regulating peptide binds to the iron exporter ferroportin and leads to its degradation, thereby inhibiting intestinal iron absorption and cellular export. Hepcidin levels are regulated on a transcriptional level by various stimuli, including transferrin saturation, erythropoietic activity, hypoxia and inflammation. Iron deficiency evokes adaptive responses resulting in alteration of cellular metabolism, changes in gene expression, activation of signalling pathways, cell cycle regulation, differentiation and cell death. Such responses are mediated by a number of iron-sensitive signalling pathways, including the IRE/IRP system, HIF and haem signalling. This review provides a molecular perspective for the clinician and highlights important biological aspects of iron deficiency.},

Under these stresses, it had been shown that transcriptions of ribosomal protein (RP) genes were decreased. However, the detailed mechanism of this downregulation has not been elucidated. In this study, we present a novel mechanistic model for a repressive role of Gcn4p on RP transcription, especially under amino-acid starvation. It was found that Gcn4p bound directly to Rap1p, which in turn inhibited Esa1p-Rap1p binding. The inhibition of Esa1p recruitment to RP promoters ultimately reduced the level of histone H4 acetylation and RP transcription. These data revealed that Gcn4p has simultaneous dual roles as a repressor for RP genes as well as an activator for amino-acid biosynthesis genes. Moreover, our results showed evidence of a novel link between general control of amino-acid biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis mediated by Gcn4p at an early stage of adaptation to amino-acid starvation.},

3-AT or aa depletion decreases amount of some RPs
Gcn4delta: less evident decrease
How does it regulate?
mRNA stability: thiolutin. No difference. Thus, Gcn4 reduces initiation.
May Rap1 mediate this change? {\&}quot;Strongly expected{\&}quot; physical interaction of Rap1 and Gcn4
Domains: DBD of Gcn4 (DBD + NLS2) and DBD of Rap1.
DNA binding of Gcn4-HA3 increases on RP gene promoters as well as on HIS3 and ADE3 (known targets). Bigger effect for known targets than for RPs. Highest occupancy in the UASrpg region. All that suggests Rap1 involvement.

        
Binding to Rap1 or trans activity?
Mutated a conserved residue in DBD. Binds Rap1 with same efficiency. Both repressed tscr of RP genes. 3-AT: repressed basal expression of Gcn4p and its induction; reduction of Ifh1, Fhl1, Sfp1
Esa1 binding was diminished in a Gcn4-dependent manner!!!

        

        
So, the overall design is: derepressed Gcn4 binds to Rap1; inhibit Rap1-Esa1 interaction; decreased acetylation.

abstract = {Growth condition perturbation or gene function disruption are commonly used strategies to study cellular systems. Although it is widely appreciated that such experiments may involve indirect effects, these frequently remain uncharacterized. Here, analysis of functionally unrelated Saccharyomyces cerevisiae deletion strains reveals a common gene expression signature. One property shared by these strains is slower growth, with increased presence of the signature in more slowly growing strains. The slow growth signature is highly similar to the environmental stress response (ESR), an expression response common to diverse environmental perturbations. Both environmental and genetic perturbations result in growth rate changes. These are accompanied by a change in the distribution of cells over different cell cycle phases. Rather than representing a direct expression response in single cells, both the slow growth signature and ESR mainly reflect a redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases, primarily characterized by an increase in the G1 population. The findings have implications for any study of perturbation that is accompanied by growth rate changes. Strategies to counter these effects are presented and discussed.},
annote = {{\#}background
 In other words, the doubling time of the various deletion strains correlates with the degree to which the recurrent signature is present. This finding agrees with the previously reported observation that the number of genes with changed expression scales with the degree of slower growth (Brauer et al, 2008; Hughes et al, 2000; Keren et al, 2013; Regenberg et al, 2006).

5) shift in cell cycle correlates with the fraction of cells in each phase

        
6) transformation
reduced false positive rate

        

        
This indicates that while the majority of the ESR can be explained by the cell cycle population shift, there is also an independent component. This likely corresponds to the well‐documented transcriptional response to general stress mediated by transcription factors such as Msn2/4 (Morano et al, 2012). Direct targets of Msn2 are indeed part of both the ESR (Gasch et al, 2000) and the slow growth signature (Supplementary Table S1). 

        
It is unlikely that all analyses will benefit from data transformation to remove the recurrent signature. },

@article{Shi2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is a fundamental requirement in scientific experiments. Some recent publications have claimed that microarrays are unreliable because lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are not reproducible in similar experiments. Meanwhile, new statistical methods for identifying DEGs continue to appear in the scientific literature. The resultant variety of existing and emerging methods exacerbates confusion and continuing debate in the microarray community on the appropriate choice of methods for identifying reliable DEG lists.

RESULTS: Using the data sets generated by the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project, we investigated the impact on the reproducibility of DEG lists of a few widely used gene selection procedures. We present comprehensive results from inter-site comparisons using the same microarray platform, cross-platform comparisons using multiple microarray platforms, and comparisons between microarray results and those from TaqMan - the widely regarded "standard" gene expression platform. Our results demonstrate that (1) previously reported discordance between DEG lists could simply result from ranking and selecting DEGs solely by statistical significance (P) derived from widely used simple t-tests; (2) when fold change (FC) is used as the ranking criterion with a non-stringent P-value cutoff filtering, the DEG lists become much more reproducible, especially when fewer genes are selected as differentially expressed, as is the case in most microarray studies; and (3) the instability of short DEG lists solely based on P-value ranking is an expected mathematical consequence of the high variability of the t-values; the more stringent the P-value threshold, the less reproducible the DEG list is. These observations are also consistent with results from extensive simulation calculations.

CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of FC-ranking plus a non-stringent P cutoff as a straightforward and baseline practice in order to generate more reproducible DEG lists. Specifically, the P-value cutoff should not be stringent (too small) and FC should be as large as possible. Our results provide practical guidance to choose the appropriate FC and P-value cutoffs when selecting a given number of DEGs. The FC criterion enhances reproducibility, whereas the P criterion balances sensitivity and specificity.},

RESULTS: We compare eight meta-analysis methods, five existing methods, two naive methods and a novel approach (mDEDS). Comparisons are performed using simulated data and two biological case studies with varying degrees of meta-analysis complexity. The performance of meta-analysis methods is assessed via ROC curves and prediction accuracy where applicable.

CONCLUSIONS: Existing meta-analysis methods vary in their ability to perform successful meta-analysis. This success is very dependent on the complexity of the data and type of analysis. Our proposed method, mDEDS, performs competitively as a meta-analysis tool even as complexity increases. Because of the varying abilities of compared meta-analysis methods, care should be taken when considering the meta-analysis method used for particular research.},

Here we developed a comprehensive computational pipeline to compare library quality metrics from any RNA-seq method. Using the well-annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome as a benchmark, we compared seven library-construction protocols, including both published and our own methods. We found marked differences in strand specificity, library complexity, evenness and continuity of coverage, agreement with known annotations and accuracy for expression profiling. Weighing each method's performance and ease, we identified the dUTP second-strand marking and the Illumina RNA ligation methods as the leading protocols, with the former benefitting from the current availability of paired-end sequencing. Our analysis provides a comprehensive benchmark, and our computational pipeline is applicable for assessment of future protocols in other organisms.},

abstract = {Chromatin regulation underlies a variety of DNA metabolism processes, including transcription, recombination, repair, and replication. To perform a quantitative genetic analysis of chromatin accessibility, we obtained open chromatin profiles across 96 genetically different yeast strains by FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements) assay followed by sequencing. While 5∼10{\%} of open chromatin region (OCRs) were significantly affected by variations in their underlying DNA sequences, subtelomeric areas as well as gene-rich and gene-poor regions displayed high levels of sequence-independent variation. We performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using the FAIRE signal for each OCR as a quantitative trait. While individual OCRs were associated with a handful of specific genetic markers, gene expression levels were associated with many regulatory loci. We found multi-target trans-loci responsible for a very large number of OCRs, which seemed to reflect the widespread influence of certain chromatin regulators. Such regulatory hotspots were enriched for known regulatory functions, such as recombinational DNA repair, telomere replication, and general transcription control. The OCRs associated with these multi-target trans-loci coincided with recombination hotspots, telomeres, and gene-rich regions according to the function of the associated regulators. Our findings provide a global quantitative picture of the genetic architecture of chromatin regulation.},

abstract = {We have determined the relationship between mRNA and protein expression levels for selected genes expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing at mid-log phase. The proteins contained in total yeast cell lysate were separated by high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Over 150 protein spots were excised and identified by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein spots were quantified by metabolic labeling and scintillation counting. Corresponding mRNA levels were calculated from serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) frequency tables (V. E. Velculescu, L. Zhang, W. Zhou, J. Vogelstein, M. A. Basrai, D. E. Bassett, Jr., P. Hieter, B. Vogelstein, and K. W. Kinzler, Cell 88:243-251, 1997). We found that the correlation between mRNA and protein levels was insufficient to predict protein expression levels from quantitative mRNA data. Indeed, for some genes, while the mRNA levels were of the same value the protein levels varied by more than 20-fold. Conversely, invariant steady-state levels of certain proteins were observed with respective mRNA transcript levels that varied by as much as 30-fold. Another interesting observation is that codon bias is not a predictor of either protein or mRNA levels. Our results clearly delineate the technical boundaries of current approaches for quantitative analysis of protein expression and reveal that simple deduction from mRNA transcript analysis is insufficient.

abstract = {In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, uptake of iron is largely regulated by the transcription factor Aft1. cDNA microarrays were used to identify new iron and AFT1-regulated genes. Four homologous genes regulated as part of the AFT1-regulon (ARN1-4) were predicted to encode members of a subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. These genes were predicted to encode proteins with 14 membrane spanning domains and were from 26 to 53{\%} identical at the amino acid level. ARN3 is identical to SIT1, which is reported to encode a ferrioxamine B permease. Deletion of ARN3 did not prevent yeast from using ferrioxamine B as an iron source; however, deletion of ARN3 and FET3, a component of the high affinity ferrous iron transport system, did prevent uptake of ferrioxamine-bound iron and growth on ferrioxamine as an iron source. The siderophore-mediated transport system and the high affinity ferrous iron transport system were localized to separate cellular compartments. Epitope-tagged Arn3p was expressed in intracellular vesicles that co-sediment with the endosomal protein Pep12. In contrast, Fet3p was expressed on the plasma membrane and was digested by extracellular proteases. These data indicate that S. cerevisiae has two pathways for ferrrioxamine-mediated iron uptake, one occurring at the plasma membrane and the other occurring in an intracellular compartment.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the transition between the fermentative and the oxidative metabolism, called the diauxic shift, is associated with major changes in gene expression. In this study, we characterized a novel family of five genes whose expression is induced during the diauxic shift. These genes, FET3, FTR1, TIS11, SIT1, and FIT2, are involved in the iron uptake pathway. We showed that their induction at the diauxic shift is positively controlled by the Snf1/Snf4 kinase pathway. The transcriptional factor Aft1p, which is known to control their induction in response to iron limitation, is also required for their induction during the diauxic shift. The increase of the extracellular iron concentration does not affect this induction, indicating that glucose exhaustion by itself would be the signal. The possibility that the Snf1/Snf4 pathway was also involved in the induction of the same set of genes in response to iron starvation was considered. We demonstrate here that this is not the case. Thus, the two signals, glucose exhaustion and iron starvation, use two independent pathways to activate the same set of genes through the Aft1p transcriptional factor.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many published manuscripts contain experiment protocols which are poorly described or deficient in information. This means that the published results are very hard or impossible to repeat. This problem is being made worse by the increasing complexity of high-throughput/automated methods. There is therefore a growing need to represent experiment protocols in an efficient and unambiguous way.

RESULTS: We have developed the Experiment ACTions (EXACT) ontology as the basis of a method of representing biological laboratory protocols. We provide example protocols that have been formalized using EXACT, and demonstrate the advantages and opportunities created by using this formalization. We argue that the use of EXACT will result in the publication of protocols with increased clarity and usefulness to the scientific community.

abstract = {Pleiotropy, the ability of a single mutant gene to cause multiple mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to pleiotropic genes, we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions.},

A large number of mutants showed altered uptake activities, and a few turned yellow when grown on agar plates with added FOB, indicating increased intracellular accumulation of undissociated siderophores. A subset consisting of 197 knockouts with altered uptake was examined further for regulated activities that mediate cellular uptake of iron from other siderophores or from iron salts. Hierarchical clustering analysis grouped the data according to iron sources and according to mutant categories. In the first analysis, siderophores grouped together with the exception of enterobactin, which grouped with iron salts, suggesting a reductive pathway of iron uptake for this siderophore. Mutant groupings included three categories: (i) high-FOB uptake, high reductase, low-ferrous transport; (ii) isolated high- or low-FOB transport; and (iii) induction of all activities. Mutants with statistically altered uptake activities included genes encoding proteins with predominant localization in the secretory pathway, nucleus, and mitochondria. Measurements of different iron-uptake activities in the yeast knockout collection make possible distinctions between genes with general effects on iron metabolism and those with pathway-specific effects.},

abstract = {Major experimental and computational efforts are targeted at the characterization of transcriptional networks on a genomic scale. The ultimate goal of many of these studies is to construct networks associating transcription factors with genes via well-defined binding sites. Weaker regulatory interactions other than those occurring at high-affinity binding sites are largely ignored and are not well understood. Here I show that low-affinity interactions are abundant in vivo and quantifiable from current high-throughput ChIP experiments. I develop algorithms that predict DNA-binding energies from sequences and ChIP data across a wide dynamic range of affinities and use them to reveal widespread functionality of low-affinity transcription factor binding. Evolutionary analysis suggests that binding energies of many transcription factors are conserved even in promoters lacking classical binding sites. Gene expression analysis shows that such promoters can generate significant expression. I estimate that while only a small percentage of the genome is strongly regulated by a typical transcription factor, up to an order of magnitude more may be involved in weaker interactions. Low-affinity transcription factor-DNA interaction may therefore be important both evolutionarily and functionally.},

abstract = {Evolution depends on the manner in which genetic variation is translated into new phenotypes. There has been much debate about whether organisms might have specific mechanisms for "evolvability," which would generate heritable phenotypic variation with adaptive value and could act to enhance the rate of evolution. Capacitor systems, which allow the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation and release it under stressful conditions, might provide such a mechanism. In yeast, the prion [PSI(+)] exposes a large array of previously hidden genetic variation, and the phenotypes it thereby produces are advantageous roughly 25{\%} of the time. The notion that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism for evolvability would be strengthened if the frequency of its appearance increased with stress. That is, a system that mediates even the haphazard appearance of new phenotypes, which have a reasonable chance of adaptive value would be beneficial if it were deployed at times when the organism is not well adapted to its environment. In an unbiased, high-throughput, genome-wide screen for factors that modify the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction, signal transducers and stress response genes were particularly prominent. Furthermore, prion induction increased by as much as 60-fold when cells were exposed to various stressful conditions, such as oxidative stress (H2O2) or high salt concentrations. The severity of stress and the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction were highly correlated. These findings support the hypothesis that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism to increase survival in fluctuating environments and might function as a capacitor to promote evolvability.},

Here, we review the recent findings in the field of sex determination in fish. In the past few years, several new master regulators of sex determination and other factors involved in sexual development have been discovered in teleosts. These data point toward a greater genetic plasticity in generating the male and female sex than previously appreciated and implicate novel gene pathways in the initial regulation of the sexual fate. Overall, it seems that sex determination in fish does not resort to a single genetic cascade but is rather regulated along a continuum of environmental and heritable factors.},

abstract = {To help understand the elusive mechanisms of zebrafish sex determination, we studied the genetic machinery regulating production and breakdown of retinoic acid (RA) during the onset of meiosis in gonadogenesis. Results uncovered unexpected mechanistic differences between zebrafish and mammals. Conserved synteny and expression analyses revealed that cyp26a1 in zebrafish and its paralog Cyp26b1 in tetrapods independently became the primary genes encoding enzymes available for gonadal RA-degradation, showing lineage-specific subfunctionalization of vertebrate genome duplication (VGD) paralogs. Experiments showed that zebrafish express aldh1a2, which encodes an RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the gonad rather than in the mesonephros as in mouse. Germ cells in bipotential gonads of all zebrafish analyzed were labeled by the early meiotic marker sycp3, suggesting that in zebrafish, the onset of meiosis is not sexually dimorphic as it is in mouse and is independent of Stra8, which is required in mouse but was lost in teleosts. Analysis of dead-end knockdown zebrafish depleted of germ cells revealed the germ cell-independent onset and maintenance of gonadal aldh1a2 and cyp26a1 expression. After meiosis initiated, somatic cell expression of cyp26a1 became sexually dimorphic: up-regulated in testes but not ovaries. Meiotic germ cells expressing the synaptonemal complex gene sycp3 occupied islands of somatic cells that lacked cyp26a1 expression, as predicted by the hypothesis that Cyp26a1 acts as a meiosis-inhibiting factor. Consistent with this hypothesis, females up-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes that entered prophase-I meiotic arrest, and down-regulated cyp26a1 in oocytes resuming meiosis. Co-expression of cyp26a1 and the pluripotent germ cell stem cell marker pou5f1(oct4) in meiotically arrested oocytes was consistent with roles in mouse to promote germ cell survival and to prevent apoptosis, mechanisms that are central for tipping the sexual fate of gonads towards the female pathway in zebrafish.},

abstract = {In this review, we provide a detailed overview of studies on the elusive sex determination (SD) and gonad differentiation mechanisms of zebrafish (Danio rerio). We show that the data obtained from most studies are compatible with polygenic sex determination (PSD), where the decision is made by the allelic combinations of several loci. These loci are typically dispersed throughout the genome, but in some teleost species a few of them might be located on a preferential pair of (sex) chromosomes. The PSD system has a much higher level of variation of SD genotypes both at the level of gametes and the sexual genotype of individuals, than that of the chromosomal sex determination systems. The early sexual development of zebrafish males is a complicated process, as they first develop a 'juvenile ovary', that later undergoes a transformation to give way to a testis. To date, three major developmental pathways were shown to be involved with gonad differentiation through the modulation of programmed cell death. In our opinion, there are more pathways participating in the regulation of zebrafish gonad differentiation/transformation. Introduction of additional powerful large-scale genomic approaches into the analysis of zebrafish reproduction will result in further deepening of our knowledge as well as identification of additional pathways and genes associated with these processes in the near future.},

The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70{\%} of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the popularity of zebrafish as a research model, its sex determination (SD) mechanism is still unknown. Most cytogenetic studies failed to find dimorphic sex chromosomes and no primary sex determining switch has been identified even though the assembly of zebrafish genome sequence is near to completion and a high resolution genetic map is available. Recent publications suggest that environmental factors within the natural range have minimal impact on sex ratios of zebrafish populations. The primary aim of this study is to find out more about how sex is determined in zebrafish.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using classical breeding experiments, we found that sex ratios across families were wide ranging (4.8{\%} to 97.3{\%} males). On the other hand, repeated single pair crossings produced broods of very similar sex ratios, indicating that parental genotypes have a role in the sex ratio of the offspring. Variation among family sex ratios was reduced after selection for breeding pairs with predominantly male or female offspring, another indication that zebrafish sex is regulated genetically. Further examinations by a PCR-based "blind assay" and array comparative genomic hybridization both failed to find universal sex-linked differences between the male and female genomes. Together with the ability to increase the sex bias of lines by selective breeding, these data suggest that zebrafish is unlikely to utilize a chromosomal sex determination (CSD) system.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our study suggests that zebrafish sex is genetically determined with limited, secondary influences from the environment. As we have not found any sign for CSD in the species, we propose that the zebrafish has a polygenic sex determination system.},

We identified loci on zebrafish chromosomes 5 (LOD score 7.9) and 16 (LOD score 9.3) governing sex determination as a complex trait, rather than as an XY or ZW genetic system. Each of these loci contains a prominent candidate gene with a conserved role in sex determination across additional species that suggest potential mechanisms of sex determination in zebrafish. The chromosome 5 locus harbors dmrt1, a key gene in sex determination from fruit flies to humans; mutation of the human DMRT1 ortholog is a cause of complete sex reversal of XY individuals. The chromosome 16 locus harbors cyp21a2; mutation of the human CYP21A2 ortholog is one of the more common causes of pseudohermaphroditism. Mutation detection at each of these candidate genes within the zebrafish cross identified hypomorphic variants on the female-associated allele of each locus. The two loci together accounted for 16{\%} of variance of the trait. Interacting environmental cues are likely to be an additional important component of sex determination in zebrafish.},

abstract = {Sex determination is the process deciding the sex of a developing embryo. This is usually determined genetically; however it is a delicate process, which in many cases can be influenced by environmental factors. The mechanisms controlling zebrafish sex determination and differentiation are not known. To date no sex linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 genes are of central interest as they are involved in regulating interrenal development and thereby steroid biosynthesis, as well as that they show expression patterns congruent with reproductive tissue differentiation and function. Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to estrogens, suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product aromatase converts testosterone into 17 beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to male to female sex reversal. FTZ-F1 genes are strongly linked to steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of Cyp19 contains binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this process. The role of FTZ-F1 and other candidates for zebrafish sex determination and differentiation is in focus of this review.},

How aneuploidy affects organismal and cellular physiology is poorly understood. We found that aneuploid budding yeast cells are under proteotoxic stress. Aneuploid strains are prone to aggregation of endogenous proteins as well as of ectopically expressed hard-to-fold proteins such as those containing polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches. Protein aggregate formation in aneuploid yeast strains is likely due to limiting protein quality-control systems, since the proteasome and at least one chaperone family, Hsp90, are compromised in many aneuploid strains. The link between aneuploidy and the formation and persistence of protein aggregates could have important implications for diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) identification plays an important role in deciphering gene regulatory codes. With comprehensive knowledge of TFBSs, one can understand molecular mechanisms of gene regulation. In the recent decades, various computational approaches have been proposed to predict TFBSs in the genome. The TFBS dataset of a TF generated by each algorithm is a ranked list of predicted TFBSs of that TF, where top ranked TFBSs are statistically significant ones. However, whether these statistically significant TFBSs are functional (i.e. biologically relevant) is still unknown. Here we develop a post-processor, called the functional propensity calculator (FPC), to assign a functional propensity to each TFBS in the existing computationally predicted TFBS datasets. It is known that functional TFBSs reveal strong positional preference towards the transcriptional start site (TSS). This motivates us to take TFBS position relative to the TSS as the key idea in building our FPC. Based on our calculated functional propensities, the TFBSs of a TF in the original TFBS dataset could be reordered, where top ranked TFBSs are now the ones with high functional propensities. To validate the biological significance of our results, we perform three published statistical tests to assess the enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, the enrichment of physical protein-protein interactions, and the tendency of being co-expressed. The top ranked TFBSs in our reordered TFBS dataset outperform the top ranked TFBSs in the original TFBS dataset, justifying the effectiveness of our post-processor in extracting functional TFBSs from the original TFBS dataset. More importantly, assigning functional propensities to putative TFBSs enables biologists to easily identify which TFBSs in the promoter of interest are likely to be biologically relevant and are good candidates to do further detailed experimental investigation. The FPC is implemented as a web tool at http://santiago.ee.ncku.edu.tw/FPC/.},

abstract = {Recent studies in cancer cells and budding yeast demonstrated that aneuploidy, the state of having abnormal chromosome numbers, correlates with elevated chromosome instability (CIN), i.e. the propensity of gaining and losing chromosomes at a high frequency. Here we have investigated ploidy- and chromosome-specific determinants underlying aneuploidy-induced CIN by observing karyotype dynamics in fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with ploidies between 1N and 2N obtained through a random meiotic process. The aneuploid strains exhibited various levels of whole-chromosome instability (i.e. chromosome gains and losses). CIN correlates with cellular ploidy in an unexpected way: cells with a chromosomal content close to the haploid state are significantly more stable than cells displaying an apparent ploidy between 1.5 and 2N. We propose that the capacity for accurate chromosome segregation by the mitotic system does not scale continuously with an increasing number of chromosomes, but may occur via discrete steps each time a full set of chromosomes is added to the genome. On top of such general ploidy-related effect, CIN is also associated with the presence of specific aneuploid chromosomes as well as dosage imbalance between specific chromosome pairs. Our findings potentially help reconcile the divide between gene-centric versus genome-centric theories in cancer evolution.},

Model, in some sense even better because cancer cells besser point mutations and chromosomal aberrations, this is a purer system

15-18 aneuploids are also unstable

Any correlation? Haploids with a few extra chromosomes appear more stable than diploids with few missing. CIN does not correlate with the number of aneuploid chrosomomes or megabases of aneuploid DNA
Particular chromosomes? ChrVI rarely appeared (quite logical). ChrVII associated with S strains and chrV was HU strains. These chromosomes do not seem enriched with CIN genes.
Inbalanced pairs? ChrII vs VIII, III vs IX, VII vs X

MAD2 on X (and its duplication earlier shown to elevate CIN in diploid background), MAD1 on VII. Might restore balance? Collected 50 more samples.

in general less stable

chrII and VII: Sli15 and Nbl1?

abstract = {Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) can lead to genetic diseases and the development of cancer. We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations. In this study, we adapted Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs. Using MLPA, we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements. The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination. Finally, we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs. Overall, we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.},

Aneuploids remain viable for a period of time and can form colonies by reducing the extent of the aneuploidy. We hypothesized that a reduction in colony formation efficiency could be used to screen for gene deletions that compromise aneuploid viability. Deletion mutants were used to measure the effects on the viability of spores derived from triploid meiosis and from a chromosome instability mutant. We found that the CCR4-NOT complex, an evolutionarily conserved general regulator of mRNA turnover, and other related factors, including poly(A)-specific nuclease for mRNA decay, are involved in aneuploid viability. Defective mutations in CCR4-NOT complex components in the distantly related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affected the viability of spores produced from triploid cells, suggesting that this complex has a conserved role in aneuploids.

abstract = {In mammalian cells, perturbations in DNA replication result in chromosome breaks in regions termed "fragile sites." Using DNA microarrays, we mapped recombination events and chromosome rearrangements induced by reduced levels of the replicative DNA polymerase-$\alpha$ in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the recombination events were nonrandomly associated with a number of structural/sequence motifs that correlate with paused DNA replication forks, including replication-termination sites (TER sites) and binding sites for the helicase Rrm3p. The pattern of gene-conversion events associated with cross-overs suggests that most of the DNA lesions that initiate recombination between homologs are double-stranded DNA breaks induced during S or G2 of the cell cycle, in contrast to spontaneous recombination events that are initiated by double-stranded DNA breaks formed prior to replication. Low levels of DNA polymerase-$\alpha$ also induced very high rates of aneuploidy, as well as chromosome deletions and duplications. Most of the deletions and duplications had Ty retrotransposons at their breakpoints.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy--the state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes--is a hallmark of cancer and a feature identified in yeast from diverse habitats. Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions. Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly. Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Short-term exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.},

abstract = {A highly efficient technique, termed PCR-mediated chromosome splitting (PCS), was used to create cells containing a variety of genomic constitutions in a haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using PCS, we constructed two haploid strains, ZN92 and SH6484, that carry multiple mini-chromosomes. In strain ZN92, chromosomes IV and XI were split into 16 derivative chromosomes, seven of which had no known essential genes. Strain SH6484 was constructed to have 14 mini-chromosomes carrying only non-essential genes by splitting chromosomes I, II, III, VIII, XI, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI. Both strains were cultured under defined nutrient conditions and analyzed for combinatorial loss of mini-chromosomes. During culture, cells with various combinations of mini-chromosomes arose, indicating that genomic reorganization could be achieved by splitting chromosomes to generate mini-chromosomes followed by their combinatorial loss. We found that although non-essential mini-chromosomes were lost in various combinations in ZN92, one mini-chromosome (18kb) that harbored 12 genes was not lost. This finding suggests that the loss of some combination of these 12 non-essential genes might result in synthetic lethality. We also found examples of genome-wide amplifications induced by mini-chromosome loss. In SH6484, the mitochondrial genome, as well as the copy number of genomic regions not contained in the mini-chromosomes, was specifically amplified. We conclude that PCS allows for genomic reorganization, in terms of both combinations of mini-chromosomes and gene dosage, and we suggest that PCS could be useful for the efficient production of desired compounds by generating yeast strains with optimized genomic constitutions.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy, a chromosome content that is not a multiple of the haploid karyotype, is associated with reduced fitness in all organisms analyzed to date. In budding yeast aneuploidy causes cell proliferation defects, with many different aneuploid strains exhibiting a delay in G1, a cell cycle stage governed by extracellular cues, growth rate, and cell cycle events. Here we characterize this G1 delay. We show that 10 of 14 aneuploid yeast strains exhibit a growth defect during G1. Furthermore, 10 of 14 aneuploid strains display a cell cycle entry delay that correlates with the size of the additional chromosome. This cell cycle entry delay is due to a delayed accumulation of G1 cyclins that can be suppressed by supplying cells with high levels of a G1 cyclin. Our results indicate that aneuploidy frequently interferes with the ability of cells to grow and, as with many other cellular stresses, entry into the cell cycle.},

The role of aneuploidy in human disease pathology, especially in cancer, has been a subject of much attention and debate over the last century due to the intrinsic complexity of the phenomena and experimental challenges. Over the last decade, yeast has been an invaluable model for driving discoveries about the genetic and molecular aspects of aneuploidy. The understanding of aneuploidy has been significantly improved owing to the methods for selectively generating aneuploid yeast strains without causing other genetic changes, techniques for detecting aneuploidy, and cutting-edge genetics and 'omics' approaches. In this review, we discuss the contribution of studies in yeast to current knowledge about aneuploidy. Special emphasis is placed on experimental features that make yeast a simpler and efficient model to investigate the complex questions in the field of aneuploidy.},

Загадочные размышления о частоте мутаций, анеуплоидии и том, что нуклеотидов много, а хромосом всего 16. 




Примерно 10{\%} генома -- гены CIN, т.е. мутации / делеции связаны с нестабильностью хромосом. Тем не менее, не надо забывать, что некоторые мутации просто вызывают отбор (например, увеличение числа копий хромосомы с гомологом повреждённого гена). 




Влияние анеуплоидии на экспрессию генов. inline + outline
Пример inline: Torres et al 2007. При дисомии по 16 хромосоме приблизительно в 2 раза увеличивается экспрессия большинства генов на этой хромосоме.
Sheltzer et al 2012: дозозависимый эффект показан для экспрессии генов для 23 анеуплоидных штаммов.
Rancati 2008, Pavelka 2010: есть гены, вылетающие за несколько сигм, однако среди них подозрительно много мишеней ТФ, которые расположены на дуплицированных хромосомах. 
А на уровне белка? В разных работах цифры разные. в последних меньше. возможно, те белки, для которых дозовой компенсации нет, быстро деградируют из-за того, что не включаются в свой родной комплекс. 




Фенотипическое проявление анеуплоидии
Обычно анеуплоидия отрицательно влияет на рост. Иногда (Gresham et al 2008 и др) это способ приноровиться к каким-нибудь невкусным условиям. 
{\&}quot;Стоимость{\&}quot; анеуплоидии для клетки пропорциональна длине соответствующей хромосомы. (Tang {\&}amp; Amon 2013). 
Пример делеции myo1: вообще-то леталь, но при дупликации хромосомы XVI выживают. можно воспроизвести внедрением всего 2 генов. 




Делеция RPS24A и RNR1 (хромосома V): дисомия IX (RNR3 и RPS24B). 




Как сделать анеуплоида?
Споруляция полиплоидов с чётным числом геномов
Радицикол
GAL1 около центромеры
Хромодукция (редкие случаи переноса хромосом между двумя штаммами при незаконченном спаривании)




Способы регистрации анеуплоидии
Электрофорез. Протокол пульс-фореза: O'Brien et al 2006. При этом нужен эуплоидный контроль.
Проточная цитометрия. Самый дешёвый метод, между прочим. SYTOX Green. позволяет определить скорее не анеуплоидию по конкретным хромосомам, а общее количество ДНК. 
a-CGH: гибридизация геномной ДНК с чипами. Продвинутые варианты включают анализ SNP. Преимущества: быстро, высокое разрешение, соотношение цена-качество. Но достаточно дорого; low-throughput
Кариотипирование с помощью ПЦР. Существуют наборы праймеров к повторяющимся элементам каждого плеча каждой из 16 хромосом. hihg-throughput.
NGS. Становится всё дешевле и дешевле. Wilkening et al 2013: 15 долларов за образец.

Genome variations arise from rare stochastic imperfections of cellular metabolism and deficiencies in maintenance genes. Here, we established the genome-wide spectrum of mutations that accumulate in a WT and in nine Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutator strains deficient for distinct genome maintenance processes: pol32$\Delta$ and rad27$\Delta$ (replication), msh2$\Delta$ (mismatch repair), tsa1$\Delta$ (oxidative stress), mre11$\Delta$ (recombination), mec1$\Delta$ tel1$\Delta$ (DNA damage/S-phase checkpoints), pif1$\Delta$ (maintenance of mitochondrial genome and telomere length), cac1$\Delta$ cac3$\Delta$ (nucleosome deposition), and clb5$\Delta$ (cell cycle progression). This study reveals the diversity, complexity, and ultimate unique nature of each mutational spectrum, composed of punctual mutations, chromosomal structural variations, and/or aneuploidies. The mutations produced in clb5$\Delta$/CCNB1, mec1$\Delta$/ATR, tel1$\Delta$/ATM, and rad27$\Delta$/FEN1 strains extensively reshape the genome, following a trajectory dependent on previous events. It comprises the transmission of unstable genomes that lead to colony mosaicisms. This comprehensive analytical approach of mutator defects provides a model to understand how genome variations might accumulate during clonal evolution of somatic cell populations, including tumor cells.},

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alterations in nucleolar architecture, the redistribution of nucleolar protein and the accumulation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (ERCs) during replicative aging have been reported. However, little is known regarding rDNA stability and changes in nucleolar activity during chronological aging (CA), which is another yeast aging model used. In the present study, the impact of aberrant cell cycle checkpoint control (knock-out of BUB1, BUB2, MAD1 and TEL1 genes in haploid and diploid hemizygous states) on CA-mediated changes in the nucleolus was studied. Nucleolus fragmentation, changes in the nucleolus size and the nucleolus/nucleus ratio, ERC accumulation, expression pattern changes and the relocation of protein involved in transcriptional silencing during CA were revealed. All strains examined were affected by oxidative stress, aneuploidy (numerical rather than structural aberrations) and DNA damage. However, the bub1 cells were the most prone to aneuploidy events, which may contribute to observed decrease in chronological lifespan. We postulate that chronological aging may be affected by redox imbalance-mediated chromosome XII instability leading to both rDNA instability and whole chromosome aneuploidy. CA-mediated nucleolus fragmentation may be a consequence of nucleolus enlargement and/or Nop2p upregulation. Moreover, the rDNA content of chronologically aging cells may be a factor determining the subsequent replicative lifespan. Taken together, we demonstrated that the nucleolus state is also affected during CA in yeast.},

However, the causes of aneuploidy-induced phenotypes and the consequences of aneuploidy on cell physiology remain poorly understood. We have performed a metaanalysis on gene expression data from aneuploid cells in diverse organisms, including yeast, plants, mice, and humans. We found highly related gene expression patterns that are conserved between species: genes that were involved in the response to stress were consistently upregulated, and genes associated with the cell cycle and cell proliferation were downregulated in aneuploid cells. Within species, different aneuploidies induced similar changes in gene expression, independent of the specific chromosomal aberrations. Taken together, our results demonstrate that aneuploidies of different chromosomes and in different organisms impact similar cellular pathways and cause a stereotypical antiproliferative response that must be overcome before transformation.},

abstract = {Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a widespread phenomenon found in unicellulars such as yeast, as well as in plants and in mammalians, especially in cancer. Aneuploidy is a genome-scale aberration that imposes a severe burden on the cell, yet under stressful conditions specific aneuploidies confer a selective advantage. This dual nature of aneuploidy raises the question of whether it can serve as a stable and sustainable evolutionary adaptation. To clarify this, we conducted a set of laboratory evolution experiments in yeast and followed the long-term dynamics of aneuploidy under diverse conditions. Here we show that chromosomal duplications are first acquired as a crude solution to stress, yet only as transient solutions that are eliminated and replaced by more efficient solutions obtained at the individual gene level. These transient dynamics of aneuploidy were repeatedly observed in our laboratory evolution experiments; chromosomal duplications gained under stress were eliminated not only when the stress was relieved, but even if it persisted. Furthermore, when stress was applied gradually rather than abruptly, alternative solutions appear to have emerged, but not aneuploidy. Our findings indicate that chromosomal duplication is a first evolutionary line of defense, that retains survivability under strong and abrupt selective pressures, yet it merely serves as a "quick fix," whereas more refined and sustainable solutions take over. Thus, in the perspective of genome evolution trajectory, aneuploidy is a useful yet short-lived intermediate that facilitates further adaptation.},

abstract = {Yeast has been established as an efficient model system to study biological principles underpinning human health. In this review we focus on yeast models covering two aspects of cancer formation and progression (i) the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK), which recapitulates metabolic features of cancer cells, including the Warburg effect, and (ii) chromosome bridge-induced translocation (BIT) mimiking genome instability in cancer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model to study cancer cell metabolism, as exponentially growing yeast cells exhibit many metabolic similarities with rapidly proliferating cancer cells. The metabolic reconfiguration includes an increase in glucose uptake and fermentation, at the expense of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (the Warburg effect), and involves a broad reconfiguration of nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Both in yeast and humans, the regulation of this process seems to have a central player, PK, which is up-regulated in cancer, and to occur mostly on a post-transcriptional and post-translational basis. Furthermore, BIT allows to generate selectable translocation-derived recombinants ("translocants"), between any two desired chromosomal locations, in wild-type yeast strains transformed with a linear DNA cassette carrying a selectable marker flanked by two DNA sequences homologous to different chromosomes. Using the BIT system, targeted non-reciprocal translocations in mitosis are easily inducible. An extensive collection of different yeast translocants exhibiting genome instability and aberrant phenotypes similar to cancer cells has been produced and subjected to analysis. In this review, we hence provide an overview upon two yeast cancer models, and extrapolate general principles for mimicking human disease mechanisms in yeast.},

Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80{\%} of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

abstract = {The coordination of subcellular processes during adaptation to environmental change is a key feature of biological systems. Starvation of essential nutrients slows cell cycling and ultimately causes G1 arrest, and nitrogen starvation delays G2/M progression. Here, we show that budding yeast cells can be efficiently returned to the G1 phase under starvation conditions in an autophagy-dependent manner. Starvation attenuates TORC1 activity, causing a G2/M delay in a Swe1-dependent checkpoint mechanism, and starvation-induced autophagy assists in the recovery from a G2/M delay by supplying amino acids required for cell growth. Persistent delay of the cell cycle by a deficiency in autophagy causes aberrant nuclear division without sufficient cell growth, leading to an increased frequency in aneuploidy after refeeding the nitrogen source. Our data establish the role of autophagy in genome stability through modulation of cell division under conditions that repress cell growth.},

abstract = {Although microorganisms are traditionally used to investigate unicellular processes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has the ability to form colonies with highly complex, multicellular structures. Colonies with the "fluffy" morphology have properties reminiscent of bacterial biofilms and are easily distinguished from the "smooth" colonies typically formed by laboratory strains. We have identified strains that are able to reversibly toggle between the fluffy and smooth colony-forming states. Using a combination of flow cytometry and high-throughput restriction-site associated DNA tag sequencing, we show that this switch is correlated with a change in chromosomal copy number. Furthermore, the gain of a single chromosome is sufficient to switch a strain from the fluffy to the smooth state, and its subsequent loss to revert the strain back to the fluffy state. Because copy number imbalance of six of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes and even a single gene can modulate the switch, our results support the hypothesis that the state switch is produced by dosage-sensitive genes, rather than a general response to altered DNA content. These findings add a complex, multicellular phenotype to the list of molecular and cellular traits known to be altered by aneuploidy and suggest that chromosome missegregation can provide a quick, heritable, and reversible mechanism by which organisms can toggle between phenotypes.},

abstract = {The vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was visualized with three unrelated fluorescent dyes: FITC-dextran, quinacrine, and an endogenous fluorophore produced in ade2 yeast. FITC-dextran, which enters cells by endocytosis, had been previously developed as a vital stain for yeast vacuoles. Quinacrine, which diffuses across membranes and accumulates in acidic compartments in mammalian cells, can also be used as a marker for yeast vacuoles. ade2 yeast accumulate an endogenous fluorophore in their vacuoles. Using these stains, yeast were examined for vacuole morphology throughout the cell division cycle. In both the parent cell and the bud, a single vacuole was the most common morphology at every stage. Two or more vacuoles could also be found in the mother cell or in the bud; however, this morphology was not correlated with any stage of the cell division cycle. Even small buds (in early S phase) often contained a small vacuole. By the time the bud was half the diameter of the mother cell, it almost always bore a vacuole. This picture of vacuole division and segregation differs from what is seen with synchronized cultures. In ade2 yeast, the bud usually inherits a substantial portion of its vacuole contents from the mother cell. We propose that vacuolar segregation is accomplished by vesicular traffic between the parent cell and the bud.},

abstract = {Adenine auxotrophy is a commonly used genetic marker in haploid yeast strains. Strain W303-1A, which carries the ade2-1 mutation, is widely used in physiological and genetic research. Yeast extract-based rich medium contains a low level of adenine, so that adenine is often depleted before glucose. This could affect the cell physiology of adenine auxotrophs grown in rich medium. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of adenine auxotrophy on cell morphology and stress physiology. Our results show that adenine depletion halts cell division, but that culture optical density continues to increase due to cell swelling. Accumulation of trehalose and a coincident 10-fold increase in desiccation stress tolerance is observed in adenine auxotrophs after adenine depletion, when compared to prototrophs. Under adenine starvation, long-term survival of W303-1A is lower than during carbon starvation, but higher than during leucine starvation. We observed drastic adenine-dependent changes in cell stress physiology, suggesting that results may be biased when adenine auxotrophs are grown in rich media without adenine supplementation.},

abstract = {Ribosomes that stall before completing peptide synthesis must be recycled and returned to the cytoplasmic pool. The protein Dom34 and cofactors Hbs1 and Rli1 can dissociate stalled ribosomes in vitro, but the identity of targets in the cell is unknown. Here, we extend ribosome profiling methodology to reveal a high-resolution molecular characterization of Dom34 function in vivo. Dom34 removes stalled ribosomes from truncated mRNAs, but, in contrast, does not generally dissociate ribosomes on coding sequences known to trigger stalling, such as polyproline. We also show that Dom34 targets arrested ribosomes near the ends of 3' UTRs. These ribosomes appear to gain access to the 3' UTR via a mechanism that does not require decoding of the mRNA. These results suggest that ribosomes frequently enter downstream noncoding regions and that Dom34 carries out the important task of rescuing them.},

Рибосомы защищают участки (footprints) разного размера

        
Есть технология под названием ribosome profiling (профилирование рибосом?).
По числу {\&}quot;следов{\&}quot;, которые выравниваются на конкретный транскрипт (занятость рибосомами), можно определить участки, в которых рибосомы приостанавливаются.

        
Чтобы количественно оценить активность Dom34, авторы статьи применили этот метод к экстрактам штамма дикого типа и штамма с делецией DOM34. Они ожидали, что в штамме dom34delta будет уменьшена занятость рибосомами мишеней Dom34p. Рибосомы стабилизировали добавлением CHX в лизирующий буфер. Добавлять CHX к культуре поостереглись, поскольку показано, что в этом случае увеличивается занятость рибосомами старт-кодонов. Дело в том, что элонгация блокирована, а инициация-то нет. 
Чтобы убедиться в отсутствии артефактов обработки CHX, проверяли другие способы стабилизации рибосом. 
1A. В присутствии CHX размер {\&}quot;следов{\&}quot; составлял 25-34 nt, мода — 28 nt. 
Замещение CHX ма GMP-CHX, смесь этих веществ, 10 mM MgCl2 (это много) или отсутствие каких-либо добавок довольно мало изменяли свойства {\&}quot;следов{\&}quot; (S1A) и слабо изменяли их картирование на транскрипты (S1B). Наиболее заметное изменение — это небольшое увеличение длины {\&}quot;следов{\&}quot; в присутствии GMP-PNP. Поскольку образцы мало отличались, их смешали и получили 30-40 миллионов картированных ридов для каждого штамма. Впоследствии использовали только CHX.

        
Также (?) изолировали более короткие (по сравнению с чем?) {\&}quot;следы{\&}quot;, поскольку подозревали, что они могут соответствовать рибосомам с обрезанным концом РНК в A-сайте. Поскольку такие транскрипты сильнее подвержены 3{\&}{\#}039;-{\&}gt;5{\&}{\#}039; деградации экзосомой, для этого эксперимента брали штамм с делецией SKI2. Длина фрагментов составляла от 15 до 24 nt; в распределении были два пика — 16 и 21 nt. 5{\&}{\#}039;-концы ридов вокруг каждого пика картировались приблизительно в 13 nt после старт-кодона (точно так же, как и риды длиной 28 nt из предыдущего эксперимента). Такое совпадение наводит на мысль, что обрезается 3{\&}{\#}039;-, а не 5{\&}{\#}039;-конец более коротких фрагментов.
Фрагменты длиной 21 и 28 nt совпадали чаще, чем 16 и 28 nt (S1D). 

        
Также изучали случаи, когда рибосомы сталкиваются и защищают фрагменты большей длины. Изучали фрагменты длиной 40-80 nt (1B) и выяснили, что они защищают фрагменты с большим разнообразием размеров до приблизительно 65 нуклеотидов. 
Пик смещён на 30 nt, что совпадает с наличием ещё одной рибосомы (S1E).
were only somewhat correlated ???
Не особо коррелировали с ридами длиной 25-34, что согласуется с идеей о том, что дисомы располагаются раньше, чем моносомы. 
Следует отметить, что в первых 25 nt дисом почти не было. Наверное, рибосома не начинает трансляцию, если предыдущая застряла в первых 25 нуклеотидах. Возможно, ей нужно место для факторов инициации. 

        
Чтобы количественно оценить общий уровень паузирования, авторы применили следующую величину: отношение ридов, картирующихся на каждую позицию, к медиане {\&}quot;занятости{\&}quot; по гену. Если в штамме больше паузированных рибосом, то там и доля сайтов с большой {\&}quot;занятостью{\&}quot; должна быть выше. Проверили: обработка 3-AT. Что логично, застревают на гистидиновых кодонах, что приводит к сдвигу (1C). И (внимание!) этот сдвиг не зависит от наличия Dom34p, что показывает, что Dom34 не трогает большинство замерших рибосом. 
S2A,B: эффекта также не было у других известных препятствий в работе рибосомы вроде ??застревания полипептида в P-сайте??? или пролин-богатых мотивов. 

        
1D. После этого попробовали посчитать обогащённость ридами в нокауте по сравнению с wt для генов с достаточным количеством ридов. 
Анализ выявил HAC1 с 30-кратным обогащением в штамме dom34delta. Также выявили ещё несколько позиций, многие из которых принадлежат известным субстратам NSD (например, SIR1).

        
S2C: вообще-то пробовали просто оценивать по средней плотности по гену ={\&}gt; ничего не нашли. Из этого сделали вывод, что различия небольшие. Возможно даже, что они небольшие и не слишком специфические. С другой стороны, возможно, что есть компенсаторные механизмы.

        
Figure 2
Обогащённость ридов из dom34delta ридами HAC1 кроется в более высокой {\&}quot;занятости{\&}quot; в какой-то конкретной точке. Что-то похожее, но сильно заметнее, наблюдали в случае дисомной фракции. Это укладывается в модель, в которой рибосомы останавливаются потому, что натыкаются на предыдущую. Что это за первичная причина? Поискали его после этого пика. Это оказался (почему???) пик в ридах длиной 15-18 nt. Эти пики часто оказывались 3{\&}{\#}039;-концом первого экзона (следовательно, разрезание было, лигирования не случилось). Идея следующая: в нокаутном штамме эти рибосомы не снимаются, и следующие в них врезаются. Эту модель также подтверждают такие данные: длина таких ридов в дисомной фракции составляла 47 nt, что соответствует одному полному месту посадки рибосомы + второй рибосоме, которая сидит на краешке.

        
Откуда вообще в цитоплазме берётся обрезанный первый экзон HAC1? Транскрипт этого гена экспортируется из ядра вместе с интроном, а затем сплайсируется только при стрессе. Трансляции этого транскрипта обычно не происходит, поскольку интрон частично комплементарен 5{\&}{\#}039;UTR. 
Следует отметить, что другие авторы ранее нашли популяцию РНК с обрезанным 5{\&}{\#}039; и показали, что в таких РНК в отсутствие стресса экзон отрезается от интрона.
Наверное, рибосомы начинают трансляцию, поскольку ингибирующего этот процесс интрона уже нет.

        
Кроме описанного выше, ещё нашли обогащённость на 40 нуклеотидов позже. Эти данные согласуются с идеей о том, что застревание рибосомы вызывает вторичные события, а именно разрезание на 70 nt раньше. 

        
Нечто похожее было ещё для некоторых генов (PAN6 на рисунке S3). Возможно, Dom34 снимает все рибосомы, висящие на обрезках мРНК, но многие такие обрезки появляются случайно, и тогда их сложно определить с помощью выбранного метода.

        
Влияет ли Dom34 на функцию HAC1 в misfolded protein response? Измерили скорость роста в присутствии туникамицина или DTT, а также профили с DTT. И там, и там всё хорошо, сплайсируется и транслируется. Следовательно, на эту функцию HAC1 Dom34 не влияет. Возможно, влияет на другие.

        
S4A. Влияет ли Hbs1 на выбор субстрата? Сделали профили для hbs1delta. Интересно ({\#}по-моему, вполне ожидаемо), что картина похожа на штамм с делецией DOM34, но менее выражена. Это согласуется с моделями о том, что Hbs1 и Dom34 работают в паре.

        
Затем оценили, где застревают рибосомы, которые предположительно снимает Dom34. Только ли в пределах кодирующей области? 

        
Figure 3A. Очень много в 3{\&}{\#}039;UTR. Целых 11{\%} генов {\&}gt; чем в 3 раза.
Figure 3B. Они на самом конце 3{\&}{\#}039;UTR и даже залезают в поли(А). 
Как и для HAC1, распределение ридов в hbs1delta было сходным (S4B). S4C: использование CHX не влияло на это распределение ({\#}скорее наоборот: если не использовать, будет то же самое).

        
3C: рассчитали среднюю занятость рибосомами для всех 3{\&}{\#}039;UTRs (выравнивали все по аннотированным сайтам полиаденилирования и усредняли). В нокаутном штамме цифра выше (ура!). Пик довольно широкий. 
Видимо, ribosomes that accumulate at the end of the 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR seem to originate upstream (не очень поняла :((( Доказательство следующее: если рассчитывать среднее только по тем генам, где много рибосом в 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR, то появляется второй пик (3D). А ещё для некоторых генов риды из дисомного пика тоже картировались на этот участок 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR (S4D). 

        
Насколько далеко рибосома проползает в поли(А)? Посчитали число стоящих подряд А в ридах до их выравнивания и с удивлением обнаружили, что их никогда не бывает больше 15. Принципиальная особенность метода? Нет. В данных mRNA-Seq много ридов с более чем 30 А. Получается, поли(А) хвост доходит только до P-сайта.

        
3F
Действительно ли рибосомы останавливаются на конце 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR? Для этого лишили дрожжей глюкозы на 1 минуту. 6 аа/sec. На 5{\&}{\#}039; UTR {\&}quot;занятость{\&}quot; была снижена примерно для первых 1000 nt, как и ожидали ({\#}не поняла расчёты.
Если взять ген с короткой 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR и ORF вроде MFA2, там действительно стало больше рибосом в 3{\&}{\#}039;. Примерно то же с HUB1 (не показано).

        
3G
Влияет ли последовательность UTR на количество зависших там рибосом? Да. Проверяли это на генах рибосомных белков (RPS19A/B, RPL19A/B). 

        
S5A: конструкция с CPR5 (на 3{\&}{\#}039;UTR накапливаются рибосомы в штамме dom34). Выяснили, что при смене 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR эффект сильно снижается.

        
Как именно? 
Взяли 201 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR (table S1).
Проанализировали нуклеотидный состав (Table S1), sequence content? (S5B-D), длину (S5E), классификацию GO, выбор стоп-кодона и окрестностей, но ничего не нашли. Возможно, просто никто ещё не открыл элемент, ответственный за аккумуляцию рибосом в dom34delta. 

        
Как рибосомы вообще попадают в 3{\&}{\#}039;UTR?
4A. Нонсенс-супрессия? Нет. 94{\%} ридов длиной 28 нт картируются в одной и той же рамке; в случае 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR таких не боле 36{\%}. 

        
Альтернативные объяснения.
Может быть, рибосомы транслируют 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR во всех 3 рамках, если рамка сдвигается на стоп-кодоне. Но никто ничего подобного не показывал.

        
Другой вариант: проблема в рециклировании, а затем сканируют.
4B. Профиль dom34delta + 3-AT. Не видно обогащённости кодонами His. 
4C. Даже если посмотреть по всему геному, в то время как в ORF гистидиновых кодонов много, в 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR такого нет. 
Значит, они не транслируют!

        
4D. Другой подход к тому же вопросу: взяли гены, где в 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR были стоп-кодоны во всех 3 рамках. Рибосомы благополучно доползали до конца 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR, да и обогащённости рибосомами вокруг стоп-кодона не было. Значит, они не транслируют.

        
Альтернативное объяснение: да вовсе не рибосомы там сидят. Маловероятно, поскольку распределение длин фрагментов очень похоже на то, что обычно встречается в моно- и дисомной фракциях (Figures S1A, S6A, and S6B), а также потому, что размер этих фрагментов изменяется при добавлении GMP-PNP.

        
А могут ли вообще 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR транслироваться?
Ввели в клетки SUP4-o
5А: занятость 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR рибосомами увеличилась, причём для генов с UAA это было куда более заметно.
5B. И риды все в одной рамке. 
5C. И терминация происходит эффективно, поскольку как только наступает второй стоп-кодон, занятость рибосомами сильно снижается. Правда, эффективность на 3 порядка меньше. Возможно, дело в сканирующих рибосомах + чтении UAA

        
Наконец, решили посмотреть, как на самом деле действуют агенты, усугубляющие эффект делеции dom34.
diamine
5D. В обоих штаммах увеличилось число ридов около поли(А).
5E. Поскольку не увеличилась доля ридов в основной рамке считывания, дело не в супрессии.

        
Обсуждение

        
методология
нашли 15-18 nt следы
+ показали, что 40-65 nt — показатель зависших рибосом.
+ показали, что голодание по гистидину или рибосомки до/после стоп-кодона — хороший показатель того, находится ли рибосома в режиме трансляции.

        
Мишеней, которые спасает Dom34, оказалось неожиданно мало. 
NGD

        
+ нашли новый класс субстратов: рибосомы, застрявшие около границы poly(A) и 3{\&}{\#}039; UTR.
И это не трансляция.
Это такое сканирование полной рибосомой? 

        
Но трансляция тоже бывает. В том числе за счёт дефектов терминации или рециклинга.
Может ли это быть кому-нибудь нужно?

        
Ещё есть гипотеза, что сканирующие рибосомы напрямую доставляют полезные компоненты от 3{\&}{\#}039; к 5{\&}{\#}039;.},

abstract = {The formation of fibrillar amyloid is most often associated with protein conformational disorders such as prion diseases, Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease. Interestingly, however, an increasing number of studies suggest that amyloid structures can sometimes play a functional role in normal biology. Several proteins form self-propagating amyloids called prions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These unique elements operate by creating a reversible, epigenetic change in phenotype. While the function of the non-prion conformation of the Rnq1 protein is unclear, the prion form, [RNQ+], acts to facilitate the de novo formation of other prions to influence cellular phenotypes. The [RNQ+] prion itself does not adversely affect the growth of yeast, but the overexpression of Rnq1p can form toxic aggregated structures that are not necessarily prions. The [RNQ+] prion is also involved in dictating the aggregation and toxicity of polyglutamine proteins ectopically expressed in yeast. Thus, the [RNQ+] prion provides a tractable model that has the potential to reveal significant insight into the factors that dictate how amyloid structures are initiated and propagated in both physiological and pathological contexts.},

abstract = {Protein analysis and genetic studies have led to the identification of the structural genes of iso-1-cytochrome c and iso-2-cytochrome c, which constitute, respectively, 95{\%} and 5{\%} of the total amount of cytochrome c in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structural gene CYC1 for iso-1-cytochrome c was previously identified by Sherman et al. (1966) and the structural gene CYC7 for iso-2-cytochrome c is identified in this investigation. A series of the following mutations were selected by appropriate procedures and shown by genetic tests to be allelic: CYC7+ →CYC7-1 →cyc7-1-1 →CYC7-1-1-A, etc., where CYC7 + denotes the wild-type allele determining iso-2-cytochrome c; CYC7-1 denotes a dominant mutant allele causing an approximately 30-fold increase of iso-2-cytochrome c with a normal sequence, and was used as an aid in selecting deficient mutants; cyc7-1-1 denotes a recessive mutant allele causing complete deficiency of iso-2-cytochrome c; and CYC7-1-1-A denotes an intragenic revertant having an altered iso-2-cytochrome c at the same level as iso-2-cytochrome c in the CYC7-1 strains. The suppression of cyc7-1-1 with the known amber suppressor SUP7-a indicated that the defect in cyc7-1-1 was an amber (UAG) nonsense codon. Sequencing revealed a single amino acid replacement of a tyrosine residue for the normal glutamine residue at position 24 in iso-2-cytochrome c from the suppressed cyc7-1-1 strain and also in five revertants of cyc7-1-1, of which three were due to extragenic suppression and two to intragenic reversion. The nature of the mutation that elevated the level of normal iso-2-cytochrome c in the CYC7-1 strain was not identified, although it occurred at or very near the CYC7 locus but outside the translated portion of the gene and it may be associated with a chromosomal aberration. Genetic studies demonstrated that CYC7 is not linked to CYC1, the structural gene for iso-1-cytochrome c.},

abstract = {Methods are described for the quantitative determinations of cytochrome c concentrations in normal and mutant strains of yeast, and for measuring the chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities of different iso-cytochromes c. Fifteen mutants of yeast, which had various degrees of cytochrome cy deficiencies, were due to mutations at six unlinked loci (cy1{\ldots} cy6). Normal yeast contained mainly iso-1-cytochrome c and small amounts (approximately 5{\%}) of iso-2-cytochrome c. cy1 mutants contained only iso-2-cytochrome c at concentrations roughly equal to that found in the normal strain. Mutants at the other loci (cy2{\ldots} cy6) contained reduced amounts of both iso-cytochromes c, in approximately the same proportion as was found in the normal strain. It is suggested that: cy1 is the structural gene for iso-1-cytochrome c; cy2 and cy3 are in some way directly concerned with cytochrome c synthesis; and cy4cy5, and cy6 are causing cytochrome c deficiencies by some secondary means. Cytochrome a was not present in mutants of yeast which were extremely low in cytochrome c.},

In order to understand the global response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to changes in DNA and protein synthesis caused by 5-fluorocytosine, genome-wide transcript profiling following 5-fluorocytosine exposure was obtained. A total of 96 genes were identified as responsive to 25 $\mu$g/ml fluorocytosine treatment for 90 min, which caused ≈17{\%} specific growth inhibition. The transcript levels of 57 genes were increased more than 2-fold, while it was found that the transcript levels of the other 39 genes decreased to a similar extent. Genes involved in DNA repair, synthesis and replication represented the highest proportion of induced genes identified, which may account for the easily acquired resistance to 5-fluorocytosine. Two enzyme encoding genes CTS1 and EGT2, which function in the separation of daughter cells from their mother cells, were down-regulated by a factor of 3.7 and 10.2, respectively, indicating that 5-fluorocytosine may also inhibit the separation of fungal cells.},

abstract = {In a variety of systems, proteins have been linked to processes historically limited to nucleic acids, such as infectivity and inheritance. These atypical proteins, termed prions, lack sequence homology but are collectively defined by their capacity to adopt multiple physical and therefore functional states in vivo. Newly synthesized prion protein generally adopts the form already present in the cell, and this in vivo folding bias directs the near faithful transmission of the corresponding phenotypic state. Switches between the prion and non-prion phenotypes can occur in vivo; however, the fate of existing protein during these transitions and its effects on the emergence of new traits remain major unanswered questions. Here, we determine the changes in protein-state that induce phenotypic switching for the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI(+)]. We show that the prion form does not need to be specified by an alternate misfolding pathway initiated during Sup35 synthesis but instead can be accessed by mature protein. This remodelling of protein from one stable form to another is accompanied by the loss of Sup35 activity, evoking a rapid change in cellular phenotype within a single cell cycle.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significance analysis plays a major role in identifying and ranking genes, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation regions, and other high-throughput features associated with illness. We propose a new approach, called gene set bagging, for measuring the probability that a gene set replicates in future studies. Gene set bagging involves resampling the original high-throughput data, performing gene-set analysis on the resampled data, and confirming that biological categories replicate in the bagged samples.

RESULTS: Using both simulated and publicly-available genomics data, we demonstrate that significant categories in a gene set enrichment analysis may be unstable when subjected to resampling. We show our method estimates the replication probability (R), the probability that a gene set will replicate as a significant result in future studies, and show in simulations that this method reflects replication better than each set's p-value.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gene lists based on p-values are not necessarily stable, and therefore additional steps like gene set bagging may improve biological inference on gene sets.},

abstract = {We have previously described an alternative form of RNA polymerase II in yeast lacking the Srb and Med proteins but including Paf1, Cdc73, Hpr1, and Ccr4. The Paf1-RNA polymerase II complex (Paf1 complex) acts in the same pathway as the Pkc1-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and is required for full expression of many cell wall biosynthetic genes. The expression of several of these cell integrity genes, as well as many other Paf1-requiring genes identified by differential display and microarray analyses, is regulated during the cell cycle. To determine whether the Paf1 complex is required for basal or cyclic expression of these genes, we assayed transcript abundance throughout the cell cycle. We found that transcript abundance for a subset of cell cycle-regulated genes, including CLN1, HO, RNR1, and FAR1, is reduced from 2- to 13-fold in a paf1{\{}Delta{\}} strain, but that this reduction is not promoter dependent. Despite the decreased expression levels, cyclic expression is still observed. We also examined the possibility that the Paf1 complex acts in the same pathway as either SBF (Swi4/Swi6) or MBF (Mbp1/Swi6), the partially redundant cell cycle transcription factors. Consistent with the possibility that they have overlapping essential functions, we found that loss of Paf1 is lethal in combination with loss of Swi4 or Swi6. In addition, overexpression of either Swi4 or Mbp1 suppresses some paf1{\{}Delta{\}} phenotypes. These data establish that the Paf1 complex plays an important role in the essential regulatory pathway controlled by SBF and MBF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The yeast ribosomal protein S9 (S9) is located at the entrance tunnel of the mRNA into the ribosome. It is known to play a role in accurate decoding and its bacterial homolog (S4) has recently been shown to be involved in opening RNA duplexes. Here we examined the effects of changing the C terminus of S9, which is rich in acidic amino acids and extends out of the ribosome surface.

RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide analysis to reveal effects at the transcription and translation levels of all yeast genes. While negligible relative changes were observed in steady-state mRNA levels, a significant number of mRNAs appeared to have altered ribosomal density. Notably, 40{\%} of the genes having reliable signals changed their ribosomal association by more than one ribosome. Yet, no general correlations with physical or functional features of the mRNA were observed. Ribosome Density Mapping (RDM) along four of the mRNAs with increased association revealed an increase in ribosomal density towards the end of the coding region for at least two of them. Read-through analysis did not reveal any increase in read-through of a premature stop codon by the mutant strain.

CONCLUSION: The ribosomal protein rpS9 appears to be involved in the translation of many mRNAs, since altering its C terminus led to a significant change in ribosomal association of many mRNAs. We did not find strong correlations between these changes and several physical features of the mRNA, yet future studies with advanced tools may allow such correlations to be determined. Importantly, our results indicate an accumulation of ribosomes towards the end of the coding regions of some mRNAs. This suggests an involvement of S9 in ribosomal dissociation during translation termination.},

We have taken advantage of this observation to carry out a genetic screen for components that show synthetic lethality (SL) with a cbp20-[Delta] cbp80-[Delta] double mutation. One set of SL interactions was due to mutations that were complemented by components of U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) and the yeast splicing commitment complex. These interactions confirm the role of yCBC in commitment complex formation. Physical interaction of yCBC with the commitment complex components Mud10p and Mud2p, which may directly mediate yCBC function, was demonstrated. Unexpectedly, we identified multiple SL mutations that were complemented by Cbf5p and Nop58p. These are components of the two major classes of yeast small nucleolar RNPs, which function in the maturation of rRNA precursors. Mutants lacking yCBC were found to be defective in rRNA processing. Analysis of the yCBC deletion phenotype suggests that this is likely to be due to a defect in the splicing of a subset of ribosomal protein mRNA precursors.

abstract = {The conserved multi-subunit Ccr4-Not complex regulates gene expression in diverse ways. In this work, we characterize the suppression of temperature sensitivity associated with a mutation in the gene encoding the scaffold subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex, NOT1, by the deletion of SPT3. We determine that the deletion of SPT3, but not the deletion of genes encoding other subunits of the SAGA complex, globally suppresses transcriptional defects of not1-2. We find that transcriptional activation in not1-2 is associated with increased binding of TFIID and SAGA at promoters of upregulated genes, and this is suppressed by the deletion of SPT3. Interestingly, Spt3p-dependent activation of transcription occurs in not1-2 even if the SAGA complex is disrupted by the deletion of SPT7 that encodes a subunit of SAGA required for its integrity. Consistent with a SAGA-independent function of Spt3p, the deletion of SPT3 displays synthetic phenotypes when combined with a deletion of SPT7. Taken together, our results provide a new view of the Spt3 protein by identifying a SAGA-independent function of this protein that is functionally linked to the Ccr4-Not complex.},

Recent studies suggest that these remodelers also participate in other DNA metabolic reactions such as replication and viral integration, and even in control of cell growth and tumor suppression. The SWI/SNF remodelers can be classified into at least two distinct subfamilies: one includes human BAF (also known as hSWI/SNF-A) and yeast SWI/SNF; the other comprises human PBAF (hSWI/SNF-B) and yeast RSC. Although both types of complexes have similar subunit composition and chromatin remodeling activity in vitro, they cannot replace each other during transcription mediated by specific activators. Thus, each remodeler probably works with a specific set of activators during gene activation. The availability of distinct types of remodelers can allow cells to regulate expression of a specific group of genes by modulating the activity of corresponding remodelers.},

abstract = {Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with defects in sucrose or raffinose fermentation were isolated. In addition to mutations in the SUC2 structural gene for invertase, we recovered 18 recessive mutations that affected the regulation of invertase synthesis by glucose repression. These mutations included five new snf1 (sucrose nonfermenting) alleles and also defined five new complementation groups, designated snf2, snf3, snf4, snf5, and snf6. The snf2, snf4, and snf5 mutants produced little or no secreted invertase under derepressing conditions and were pleiotropically defective in galactose and glycerol utilization, which are both regulated by glucose repression. The snf6 mutant produced low levels of secreted invertase under derepressing conditions, and no pleiotropy was detected. The snf3 mutants derepressed secreted invertase to 10-35{\%} the wild-type level but grew less well on sucrose than expected from their invertase activity; in addition, snf3 mutants synthesized some invertase under glucose-repressing conditions.--We examined the interactions between the different snf mutations and ssn6, a mutation causing constitutive (glucose-insensitive) high-level invertase synthesis that was previously isolated as a suppressor of snf1. The ssn6 mutation completely suppressed the defects in derepression of invertase conferred by snf1, snf3, snf4 and snf6, and each double mutant showed the constitutivity for invertase typical of ssn6 single mutants. In contrast, snf2 ssn6 and snf5 ssn6 strains produced only moderate levels of invertase under derepressing conditions and very low levels under repressing conditions. These findings suggest roles for the SNF1 through SNF6 and SSN6 genes in the regulation of SUC2 gene expression by glucose repression.},

abstract = {The [PSI(+)] yeast prion is formed when Sup35 misfolds into amyloid aggregates. [PSI(+)], like other yeast prions, is dependent on the molecular chaperone, Hsp104, which severs the prion seeds so they pass on as the yeast divide. Surprisingly, however, overexpression of Hsp104 also cures [PSI(+)]. Several models have been proposed to explain this effect: inhibition of severing, asymmetric segregation of the seeds between mother and daughter cells, and dissolution of the prion seeds. First, we found that neither the kinetics of curing nor the heterogeneity in the distribution of the GFP-labeled Sup35 foci in partially cured yeast are compatible with Hsp104 overexpression curing [PSI(+)] by inhibiting severing. Second, we ruled out the asymmetric segregation model by showing that the extent of curing was essentially the same in mother and daughter cells and that the fluorescent foci did not distribute asymmetrically, but rather there was marked loss of foci in both mother and daughter cells. These results suggest that Hsp104 overexpression cures [PSI(+)] by dissolution of the prion seeds in a two step process. First, trimming of the prion seeds by Hsp104 reduces their size and then, their amyloid core is eliminated most likely by proteolysis.},

Upon co-expression of MS2-CP fused with GFP, specific endogenously expressed mRNAs can be visualized in vivo for the first time.

DNA microarrays measured the expression of 6388 genes and wall removal resulted initially in over-expression of 861 genes that decayed later on, a behaviour expected from a transient stress response. Kinetics of expression divided the genes into 25 clusters. Transcription of the genes from clusters 14-25 was initially up-regulated, suggesting that the grouped genes permitted cell adaptation to the removal of the wall. Clustering of genes involved in "wall structure and biosynthesis" showed that most of them had initially low levels of expression that increased along the process. Analysis by use of the T-profiler showed that the group of "structural components of the wall" was up-regulated after two hours and remained as such during the process.

abstract = {Effects of suboptimal temperatures on transcriptional regulation in yeast have been extensively studied in batch cultures. To eliminate indirect effects of specific growth rates that are inherent to batch-cultivation studies, genome-wide transcriptional responses to low temperatures were analyzed in steady-state chemostats, grown at a fixed specific growth rate (0.03 h(-1)). Although in vivo metabolic fluxes were essentially the same in cultures grown at 12 and at 30 degrees C, concentrations of the growth-limiting nutrients (glucose or ammonia) were higher at 12 degrees C. This difference was reflected by transcript levels of genes that encode transporters for the growth-limiting nutrients. Several transcriptional responses to low temperature occurred under both nutrient-limitation regimes. Increased transcription of ribosome-biogenesis genes emphasized the importance of adapting protein-synthesis capacity to low temperature. In contrast to observations in cold-shock and batch-culture studies, transcript levels of environmental stress response genes were reduced at 12 degrees C. Transcription of trehalose-biosynthesis genes and intracellular trehalose levels indicated that, in contrast to its role in cold-shock adaptation, trehalose is not involved in steady-state low-temperature adaptation. Comparison of the chemostat-based transcriptome data with literature data revealed large differences between transcriptional reprogramming during long-term low-temperature acclimation and the transcriptional responses to a rapid transition to low temperature.},

abstract = {The isoprenoid pathway in yeasts is important not only for sterol biosynthesis but also for the production of nonsterol molecules, deriving from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), implicated in N-glycosylation and biosynthesis of heme and ubiquinones. FPP formed from mevalonate in a reaction catalyzed by FPP synthase (Erg20p). In order to investigate the regulation of Erg20p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we searched for its protein partners using a two-hybrid screen, and identified five interacting proteins, among them Yta7p. Subsequently, we showed that Yta7p was a membrane-associated protein localized both to the nucleus and to the endoplasmic reticulum. Deletion of YTA7 affected the enzymatic activity of cis-prenyltransferase (the enzyme that utilizes FPP for dolichol biosynthesis) and the cellular levels of isoprenoid compounds. Additionally, it rendered cells hypersensitive to lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) that acts upstream of FPP synthase in the isoprenoid pathway. While HMGR is encoded by two genes, HMG1 and HMG2, only HMG2 overexpression was able to restore growth of the yta7Delta cells in the presence of lovastatin. Moreover, the expression level of the S. cerevisiae YTA7 gene was altered upon impairment of the isoprenoid pathway not only by lovastatin but also by zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of squalene synthase. Altogether, these results provide substantial evidence of Yta7p involvement in the regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis.},

@article{Winkler2012a,
abstract = {Hsp100 and Hsp70 chaperones in bacteria, yeast, and plants cooperate to reactivate aggregated proteins. Disaggregation relies on Hsp70 function and on ATP-dependent threading of aggregated polypeptides through the pore of the Hsp100 AAA(+) hexamer. In yeast, both chaperones also promote propagation of prions by fibril fragmentation, but their functional interplay is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that Hsp70 chaperones were essential for species-specific targeting of their Hsp100 partner chaperones ClpB and Hsp104, respectively, to heat-induced protein aggregates in vivo. Hsp70 inactivation in yeast also abrogated Hsp104 targeting to almost all prions tested and reduced fibril mobility, which indicates that fibril fragmentation by Hsp104 requires Hsp70. The Sup35 prion was unique in allowing Hsp70-independent association of Hsp104 via its N-terminal domain, which, however, was nonproductive. Hsp104 overproduction even outcompeted Hsp70 for Sup35 prion binding, which explains why this condition prevented Sup35 fragmentation and caused prion curing. Our findings indicate a conserved mechanism of Hsp70-Hsp100 cooperation at the surface of protein aggregates and prion fibrils.},

1. E. coli: functional YFP fusion versions of the chaperones
dnaK103(am) strain: polar foci of DnaJ-YFP already detectable at 30 degrees. It can be explained by increased protein misfolding and aggregation in the absence of DnaK

        
Figure 1
1A. We analyzed the interdependence of DnaK and ClpB with respect to aggregate binding. DnaK-YFP still exhibited heat-induced relocalization in deltaclpB cells, whereas the relocalization of ClpB-YFP was strongly affected in dnaK103(am) cells.The absence of ClpB-YFP foci after heat stress is not caused by differences in protein aggregation, as thermolabile MetA-YFP (Gur et al., 2002;Winkler et al., 2010) still formed heat-induced foci in dnaK103(am) cells at 45°C (Fig. S1 B). Furthermore, the expression of the DnaK-V436F protein, which is defective in substrate interaction (Mayer et al., 2000), could not complement the aggregate binding deficiency of ClpB in dnaK103(am) cells. These findings demonstrate that initial association of DnaK via DnaJ is a prerequisite for ClpB targeting to aggregates.

        
We also considered an alternative explanation: DnaK and DnaJ may not act by initial targeting of ClpB to protein aggregates but by stabilizing intrinsically unstable interactions of ClpB with aggregated proteins. No.
Together these findings indicate a binding hierarchy for disaggregating chaperones to protein aggregates in E. coli: DnaJ mediates the association of DnaK with aggregated proteins, which then is a prerequisite for subsequent recruitment of ClpB.

1B. S. cerevisiae ssa2 ssa3 ssa4 ssa1-45(ts)
Hsp104-CFP + mCitrine-Luciferase were expressed in ssa1-45(ts) cells and isogenic SSA1 cells. Levels of Hsp104-CFP and Ssa1 in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells were identical at all applied temperatures (Fig. S2 C).
mCitrine: foci at 45 (not at 25 and 37)
In SSA1 cells, Hsp104-CFP colocalized with mCitrine-Luciferase foci, whereas in ssa1-45(ts) cells Hsp104-CFP did not relocalize.

        
Figure 2
{\#}background
Hsp104 cannot replace ClpB function in E. coli clpB cells and, vice versa, bacterial ClpB does not complement the defects of S. cerevisiae hsp104 cells (Parsell et al., 1993; Glover and Lindquist, 1998).

        
2A. We hypothesized that the targeting function of Hsp70 might be responsible for the observed species specificity. We expressed Hsp104-YFP in E. coli clpB cells and monitored its localization at 30°C and 45°C. Heat shock did only cause relocalization to polar sites in a minority of cells, in contrast to ClpB-YFP, which demonstrates that Hsp104 does not efficiently associate with protein aggregates in E. coli.

        
Is it absence of correct Hsp70 partner? The Hsp104 variant HBH-YFP harbors the E. coli ClpB M domain and, in contrast to Hsp104-YFP, localized to polar foci in all clpB cells after heat treatment (Fig. 2 A).
S1E: this effect was lost in dnaK103(am)

        
Targeting of HBH-YFP to protein aggregates in clpB cells also allowed for partial recovery of aggregated Luciferase, whereas expression of Hsp104-YFP did not allow for Luciferase reactivation (Fig. 2 B). The recovery of Luciferase activity by HBH-YFP was minor as compared with ClpB-YFP.

        
Figure 3. Prions

        
Whether the interaction of Hsp104 with prion fibrils, is also affected by Hsp70. We first focused on [PIN + ]/[RNQ + ] prion. 
(Fig. S2 A)
Expression of Rnq1-mCherry or Rnq1-GFP in SSA1 or ssa1-45(ts) cells ={\&}gt; foci, which disappeared after prolonged incubation of the cells with GdnHCl. 
(Fig. S2 B)
Furthermore, Rnq1-GFP formed SDS-resistant, amyloid-like aggregates that were converted to soluble Rnq1-GFP upon GdnHCl treatment .

        
Colocalization studies in yeast cells and confirmed them by line intensity plot profiles (Fig. S3, A–P). Coexpressed Hsp104-CFP and Rnq1-mCherry in ssa1-45(ts) and isogenic SSA1 yeast cells. At 25°C, Hsp104-CFP colocalizes with Rnq1-mCherry
foci in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells (Figs. 3 A and S3 A). Colocalization was additionally confirmed by confocal microscopy (unpublished data). Upon temperature upshift to 37°C, the colocalization remained in SSA1 cells, but not in ssa1-45(ts) cells, in which Hsp104-CFP showed a diffuse cytosolic staining despite the presence of Rnq1-mCherry foci. When ssa1-45(ts) cells were shifted back from 37°C to 25°C, binding of Hsp104-CFP to Rnq1-mCherry was restored (Figs. 3 B and Fig. S3 B).

        
Ssa1 binding to Rnq1-GFP fibrils in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells by immunofluorescence. Ssa1 foci were observed at 25°C upon expression of Rnq1-GFP, and both Ssa1 and Rnq1-GFP foci colocalized in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells, demonstrating efficient interaction of Ssa1 with prion fibrils (Figs. 3 C and S3 C). Inactivation of Ssa1 in ssa1-45(ts) cells abrogated Ssa1 binding to Rnq1-GFP foci, providing an explanation for the observed loss of Hsp104-CFP binding (Figs. 3 C and S3 C).

        
Figure 4. Photobleaching.
We determined the dynamics of Rnq1-GFP foci in the presence and absence of functional Ssa1 by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments. Here, a small cytosolic area within SSA1 or ssa1-45(ts) cells harboring Rnq1-GFP foci outside of the bleach area was repeatedly bleached with a laser pulse, and the fluorescence intensity of Rnq1-GFP foci was determined. At 25°C, a rapid drop of Rnq1-GFP foci fluorescence was observed in both cells, indicating a dynamic exchange of Rnq1-GFP molecules between cytosol and foci (Fig. 4 A). To exclude photobleaching effects, we bleached an area in a neighboring cell located in close proximity to the Rnq1-GFP foci. No decrease in Rnq1-GFP foci intensity was observed (Fig. 4 A). We also determined the mobility of diffuse Rnq1-GFP fluorescence in [pin  ] cells, revealing a significantly higher mobility (Fig. 4 A).

        
Figure 5. How GndHCl works
We also monitored whether inhibition of Hsp104 by Gdn-HCl affects Hsp104 binding to Rnq1-GFP foci. The colocalization frequency of Hsp104-CFP and Rnq1-mCherry was strongly reduced upon treatment with GdnHCl, whereas Ssa1 binding to Rnq1-GFP remained unaffected (Figs. 5 and S3 D). These findings shed new light on the mechanism of Hsp104 inhibition by GdnHCl, which has been previously only demonstrated to reduce Hsp104 ATPase activity. Our data suggest that GdnHCl additionally affects Ssa1-Hsp104 cooperation

        
Figure 6. PSI+
We coexpressed Hsp104-CFP and NM-YFP in ssa1-45(ts) and SSA1 cells
Overproduction of NM-YFP caused formation of foci in both yeast strains at 25 C and 37, which were lost after prolonged incubation with GdnHCl (Fig. S2 E, F).

        
At 25°C, Hsp104-CFP binds to NM-YFP foci in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells (Figs. 6 A and S3 E). Interestingly, colocalization was not altered upon inactivation of Ssa1. This contrasts the observed Ssa dependence of Hsp104 binding on either heat-induced aggregates (Fig. 1 B) or Rnq1-mCherry prion fibrils (Fig. 3 A).

        
To test whether this discrepancy is caused by differences in Ssa1 binding to NM-YFP fibrils as compared with Rnq1-GFP fibrils, we monitored Ssa1 localization in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells harboring NM-YFP foci by immuno­fluorescence (Figs. S3 H and S4 A).
We conclude that Hsp104-CFP still binds to NM-YFP fibrils in the absence of Ssa1.

        
Figure 6. FLIP
To elucidate potential differences in the mode of Hsp104
association with NM-YFP fibrils and Rnq1-mCherry fibrils), we investigated the dynamics of this inter­action by FLIP. A rapid drop of Hsp104-CFP fluorescence colo-calizing with NM-YFP foci was observed at 25°C in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells, indicating a dynamic exchange of Hsp104-CFP with prion fibrils (Fig. 6 B). When shifting ssa1-45(ts) cells from 25°C to 37°C, Hsp104-CFP binding to NM-YFP was stabilized when compared with Ssa1 cells (Fig. 6 B). Thus, although Ssa1 is not required for binding of Hsp104 to NM-YFP fibrils, its inactivation renders the association of Hsp104 largely immobile.

        
We therefore probed the physical state of NM-YFP foci in SSA1 and ssa1-45(ts) cells at 25°C and 37°C by FLIP experiments (Fig. 6 C). NM-YFP foci were mobile in both cells at 25°C, which indicates a dynamic exchange of NM-YFP molecules with the cytosol, in agreement with previous findings

        
Full length? We analyzed the binding of red fluorescent Hsp104-eqFP611 to Sup35-GFP, which had been characterized previously (Wu et al., 2006; Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2007). Hsp104-eqFP611 still colocalized with Sup35 in ssa1-45(ts) cells at 37°C; however, the interaction became immobile in the absence of functional Ssa1 (Figs. S2 G and S3, F and G). Accordingly, the mobility of Sup35-GFP foci was especially reduced in ssa1-45(ts) cells at 37°C, matching the stabilization determined in SSA1 cells upon Hsp104 inhibition by GdnHCl treatment (Fig. S2 H).

        
Figure 7. 
{\#}background
Although the N domain is not required for [PSI + ] propagation, it is essential for the curing of yeast cells from Sup35 prions by high Hsp104 levels, which implies an interaction between the Hsp104 N domain and Sup35 fibrils (Hung and Masison, 2006).

        
We therefore produced NM-YFP in SSA1 or ssa1-45(ts) cells expressing N-Hsp104-CFP and performed immunofluorescence against Hsp104 (Figs. 7 A and S3 L). At 25°C, N-Hsp104 colocalized with NM-YFP foci in both strains, whereas at 37°C N-Hsp104 colocalized with NM-YFP foci only in SSA1 cells but not in ssa1-45(ts) cells.

        
As a control, we also performed immunofluorescence with full-length Hsp104 in SSA1 or ssa1-45(ts) cells expressing NM-YFP. Here, binding of Hsp104 to NM-YFP foci was still observed in both strains at 37°C (Figs. S3 J and S5 A).

        
The data presented here tempted us to speculate that the ability of Hsp104 to bind to NM-YFP fibrils via its N domain enables Hsp104 to specifically outcompete Ssa1 for fibril binding if present at high levels. To test this scenario, we first expressed NM-YFP in SSA1 cells, followed by copper-
controlled overproduction of either Hsp104 or N-Hsp104 (Fig. S5 B). In agreement with earlier findings (Zhou et al., 2001), high Hsp104 levels specifically led to the appearance of ribbon-like NM-YFP structures in some cells and also an increased cytosolic fluorescence of NM-YFP, which indicates prion curing (Fig. S5 C).

        
Importantly, overproduction of Hsp104 strongly reduced Ssa1 binding to NM-YFP foci and ribbons, as determined by immuno­fluorescence, whereas overproduction of N-Hsp104 had no effect in comparison to the vector-only control (Figs. 7 B and S3 K).

        
As a control, we monitored the consequences of Hsp104 overproduction on Ssa1 binding to Rnq1-GFP foci because increased Hsp104 levels do not lead to [RNQ + ] curing (Fig. S5 D)

        
We also tested the consequences of Hsp104 and N-Hsp104 overproduction on NM-YFP foci mobility by FLIP experiments. High Hsp104 levels reduced NM-YFP mobility, whereas N-Hsp104 had no significant effect (Fig. 7 C). Ssa1-independent binding of Hsp104 prevents NM-YFP fragmentation and underlines the key role of Ssa1 in prion severing.

        
Figure 8. Hsp90
The deletion of the Hsp90 co-chaperone Sti1 and inhibition of Hsp90 activity by Radicicol treatment have been shown to largely diminish [PSI + ] curing by Hsp104 overproduction (Moosavi et al., 2010; Reidy and Masison, 2010). We therefore tested whether a reduction of Hsp90 activity has an
impact on Ssa1 binding to NM-Sup35 fibers upon Hsp104 overproduction. In the presence of Radicicol, we observed a strong increase in the fraction of SSA1 cells showing colocalization of Ssa1 and NM-YFP foci in the presence of high Hsp104 levels (Fig. 8 A). Similar findings were obtained when colocalization of Ssa1 and NM-YFP foci in SSA1 sti1 cells upon Hsp104 overproduction was determined (Fig. 8 B).

        
Figure 9. Other prions

        
To further generalize our observation that Ssa1 recruits
Hsp104 to prion fibrils, we analyzed the binding of Hsp104
to the recently identified prion protein Mot3 and the potential
prion proteins Lsm4 and Nrp1 (Alberti et al., 2009). To visu-
alize the formation of respective prion fibrils in yeast cells,
YFP fusion proteins of the respective prion domains were ex-
pressed at 25°C. Upon overexpression, Mot3-YFP and Lsm4-
YFP formed foci. Nrp1-YFP also produced foci in most cells,
whereas few cells (2{\%}) showed ribbon-like structures (Figs. 9
and S3, N–P).The localization pattern of the prion domain–YFP fusion proteins was reverted (Fig. S2, I–K).

        
Hsp104-CFP was coexpressed with the individual prion–YFP. 
At 25°C, Hsp104-
CFP revealed colocalization with all tested prion fibrils in both
cell types. Temperature upshift to 37°C specifically abrogated
Hsp104-CFP binding to Mot3-YFP, Lsm4-YFP, and Nrp1-YFP
foci and Nrp1-YFP ribbons in ssa1-45(ts) cells but not in SSA cells (Figs. 9 and S3, N–P). This binding deficiency correlated
with a loss of Ssa1 prion interaction in ssa1-45(ts) cells at ele-
vated temperatures (Figs. S4, B–D), demonstrating that the role
of Ssa1 as a recruitment factor for Hsp104 binding to prion
fibrils is conserved.

        
{\#}discussion
explanation for several enigmatic observations, including that
(a) Sup35NM fibril sizes increase upon Hsp104 overproduction
(Kryndushkin et al., 2003); (b) simultaneous Ssa1 and Hsp104
co-overproduction does not result in [PSI + ] curing, as such con-
ditions probably prevent the displacement of Ssa1 from Sup35
fibrils (Newnam et al., 1999); and (c) Hsp104 overproduction
inhibits propagation of [PSI + ] but not of other prions (Moriyama
et al., 2000).

In the present work, we analyze the kinetics of protein fibrillation when the process is governed solely by elongation of initially appeared fibrils in the protein solution. We derive exact expressions for the time dependences of the fibrillation degree, the concentration of monomeric protein in the solution, and the average fibril size. Furthermore, we present formulas for the initial fibrillation rate and the half-fibrillation time in terms of experimentally controllable quantities. The results obtained provide a mechanistic insight into the kinetics of protein fibrillation mediated by fibril elongation.

Transformation of proteins into prions is generally accompanied by an increase in $\beta$-sheet structure and a propensity to aggregate into oligomers. Some prions are beneficial and perform cellular functions, whereas others cause neurodegeneration. In mammals, more than a dozen proteins that become prions have been identified, and a similar number has been found in fungi. In both mammals and fungi, variations in the prion conformation encipher the biological properties of distinct prion strains. Increasing evidence argues that prions cause many neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Lou Gehrig's diseases, as well as the tauopathies. The majority of NDs are sporadic, and 10{\%} to 20{\%} are inherited.

Remarkably, a number of human proteins containing prion-like domains, defined as domains with compositional similarity to yeast prion domains, have recently been linked to various human degenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This suggests that the lessons learned from yeast prions may help in understanding these human diseases. In this review, we examine what has been learned about the amino acid sequence basis for prion aggregation in yeast, and how this information has been used to develop methods to predict aggregation propensity. We then discuss how this information is being applied to understand human disease, and the challenges involved in applying yeast prediction methods to higher organisms.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are superb models for understanding the mechanisms of self-perpetuating protein aggregates formation. [PSI(+) ] stands among the most documented yeast prions and results from self-assembly of the translation termination factor Sup35p into protein fibrils. A plethora of cellular factors were shown to affect [PSI(+) ] formation and propagation. Clearance of Sup35p prion particles is however poorly understood and documented. Here, we investigated the role of the proteasome in the degradation of Sup35p and in [PSI(+) ] prion propagation. We found that cells lacking the RPN4 gene, which have reduced intracellular proteasome pools, accumulated Sup35p and have defects in [PSI(+) ] formation and propagation. Sup35p is degraded in vitro by the 26S and 20S proteasomes in a ubiquitin-independent manner, generating an array of amyloidogenic peptides derived from its prion-domain. We also demonstrate the formation of a proteasome-resistant fragment spanning residues 83-685 which is devoid of the prion-domain that is essential for [PSI(+) ] propagation. Most important was the finding that the 26S and 20S proteasomes degrade Sup35p fibrils in vitro and abolish their infectivity. Our results point to an overlooked role of the proteasome in clearing toxic protein aggregates, and have important implications for a better understanding of the life cycle of infectious protein assemblies.},

SCRaMbLE: сайты loxPsym ненаправленно перестраивают ДНК. Вставляли через 3 п.н. после каждого не жизненно важного гена и в прочих участках вроде LTR и теломер.
        

        S. cerevisiae: размер генома 12,5 Мб, которые запакованы в 16 хромосом. {\~{}}6000 генов, из которых {\~{}}5000 поодиночке не являются жизненно важными. Тем не менее, никто не знает, какие из этих генов можно выбросить одновременно. В этой работе применили следующий подход: маркируем все не жизненно необходимые гены сайтами loxPsym по флангам, что позволяет нам начинать эволюцию по заказу — SCRaMbLEing). Также синтетический геном позволит ответить на вопрос, сколько пар, троек, четвёрок генов можно удалить, не убив дрожжу. Итак, международная команда учёных завела проект Synthetic Yeast 2.0, и здесь представлены результаты очередного этапа (первая полностью сделанная хромосома). 
Третья хромосома является третьей по величине, была первой секвенирована и содержит локус типа спаривания. Изменяли её в соответствии с принципами проекта. Эти изменения включают делеции, вставки и замены: F1, FS1, FS2, supplementary text.
F2 Процесс включал 3 этапа: (i), (F2A) сборка синтезированных кусочков длиной 60-79 нуклеотидов в строительные блоки (“кирпичики”, building blocks) длиной 750 нуклеотидов силами студентов. S3: объяснение названий кусочков. (ii) Левое плечо из 133 кирпичиков и правое из 234 кирпичиков были собраны в 44 и 83 перекрывающихся миникуска (minichunks) длиной от {\~{}}2 до 4 kb (TS1, F2B, FS4). (iii) Миникусочки были собраны так, что перекрывались на 1 блок. Собирали с помощью гомологичной рекомбинации и разных аллелей маркерных генов по {\~{}}12 миникусочков. Заменили исходную на синтетическую за 11 трансформаций F2C, TS2.
        
        
          
            
Сравнение геномов
        
        
        
Сначала провели PCRTag analysis. Синтетическая есть, исходной нет. F3A; see supplementary text; FS5–S7.
        
Кроме того, сделали пульс-форез, который подтвердил наличие хромосомы меньшего размера (F3B, FS8). В процессе выяснили, что у исходного штамма были некоторые хромосомные аберрации, а в процессе возникли ещё некоторые, однако третью хромосому они не затронули (FS8). Эти аномалии убрали скрещиванием с BY4742 с получением MATalpha, у которого всех хромосомы, кроме III, совпадают по длине с BY4742 (97, 97* на FS8). Саузерн-блот подтвердил наличие UTC (universal telomere cap) на концах хромосомы (S9). 
Наконец, подтвердили полногеномным секвенированием. Нашли 10 замен, из 9 которых — индели. Из этих 9 3 — предсуществующие, но, вероятно, неопасные замены, образовавшиеся в ходе сборки. Ещё 2 — куски WT (вероятно, не заметили при анализе PCRTags) может быть, это множественные обмены? авторы не обсуждают; вернее, они используют не совсем понятный термин patcht. Оставшиеся 4 — это замены на границах последовательностей (следовательно, гомологичная рекомбинация у дрожжей не настолько точна, насколько принято думать). Десятая — отсутствие сайта loxPsym.         
        
          
            
Влияние на фенотип
        
        
        
Есть ли отличия? Проверили (по сравнению с BY4247) размер колоний, кривые роста и морфологию клеток. Кривые роста: разницы нет FS10. По размеру колоний разницы тоже нет (F3C). Это показывает, что разница по устойчивости к высоким концентрациям сорбитола (synIIIL чуть хуже) не так уж и важна (S11). А где это на картинке? Морфология тоже похожа S12, однако после 3 раунда замен нашли 1{\%} клеток с аномальным почкованием. 
Чтобы уточнить, секвенировали РНК. 10 генов экспрессировались по-разному (P {\&}lt; 7.4 × 10 −6 for 5{\%} family-wise error rate based on 6756 loci with at least one mapped read and also corresponding to 1{\%} false discovery rate). Из этих 10 генов 8 были удалены с синтетической хромосомы; остаются HSP30 (16x down) и PCL1 XIV (16x up) S13. 
Из этой хромосомы удалили 11 генов tRNA, которые, как говорят, образуют посадочную площадку для когезинов. Это может приводить к общей дестабилизации хромосомы. В то же время, удаление повторяющихся последовательностей ДНК может увеличивать стабильность. По всем этим и другим причинам необходимо было проверить стабильность, т.е. частоту потери, синтетической III хромосомы. Анализ PCRTags показал, что хромосома стабильна в 125 поколениях и 30 независимых линиях 4A. Для оценки частоты потери хромосомы использовали a-faker assay да это же альфа-тест :) Несмотря на всё, что с ней сделали, хромосома стабильна 4B
        
Вернёмся к тРНК и посадке когезина. Нужны ли для этого сами гены тРНК или же важна окружающая последовательность? Сделали ChIP S14. Сравнили связывание когезина на исходной хромосоме III и синтетической хромосоме. В целом похоже, но есть 2 случая снижения связывания и 1 случай полного его отсутствия. 
Кроме того, удаляли некоторые ориджины репликации (TS9,

S16: SCRaMbLEing в гаплоидных штаммах, содержащих synIII, ведёт к летальности в связи с потерей жизненно необходимых генов. Чтобы посмотреть на более близкие к жизни эффекты, использовали диплоидные штаммы synIII/III FS17. В эти штаммы загнали плазмиду Cre-EBD и кратко индуцировали эстрадиолом. F4С, FS18: неожиданно получили очень значительное число производных a-типа спаривания. Что это? Все они потеряли разные кусочки III хромосомы, включающие локус типа спаривания.

        

        
Вывод? В этой хромосоме изменено довольно много, а она работает. Следовательно, подобные штуки делать можно. И это только один из множества возможных вариантов...

abstract = {Double-stranded RNA has been shown to induce gene silencing in diverse eukaryotes and by a variety of pathways. We have examined the taxonomic distribution and the phylogenetic relationship of key components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery in members of five eukaryotic supergroups. On the basis of the parsimony principle, our analyses suggest that a relatively complex RNAi machinery was already present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and consisted, at a minimum, of one Argonaute-like polypeptide, one Piwi-like protein, one Dicer, and one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. As proposed before, the ancestral (but non-essential) role of these components may have been in defense responses against genomic parasites such as transposable elements and viruses. From a mechanistic perspective, the RNAi machinery in the eukaryotic ancestor may have been capable of both small-RNA-guided transcript degradation as well as transcriptional repression, most likely through histone modifications. Both roles appear to be widespread among living eukaryotes and this diversification of function could account for the evolutionary conservation of duplicated Argonaute-Piwi proteins. In contrast, additional RNAi-mediated pathways such as RNA-directed DNA methylation, programmed genome rearrangements, meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA, and miRNA-mediated gene regulation may have evolved independently in specific lineages.},

abstract = {Variation in amyloid structures profoundly influences a wide array of pathological phenotypes in mammalian protein conformation disorders and dominantly inherited phenotypes in yeast. Here, we describe, for the first time, naturally occurring, self-propagating, structural variants of a prion protein isolated from wild strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Variants of the [RNQ(+) ] prion propagating in a variety of wild yeast differ biochemically, in their intracellular distributions, and in their ability to promote formation of the [PSI(+) ] prion. [PSI(+) ] is an epigenetic regulator of cellular phenotype and adaptability. Strikingly, we find that most natural [RNQ(+) ] variants induced [PSI(+) ] at high frequencies and the majority of [PSI(+) ] variants elicited strong cellular phenotypes. We hypothesize that the presence of an efficient [RNQ(+) ] template primes the cell for [PSI(+) ] formation in order to induce [PSI(+) ] in conditions where it would be advantageous. These studies utilize naturally occurring structural variants to expand our understanding of the consequences of diverse prion conformations on cellular phenotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) is a fundamental step in studies that perform genome wide expression profiling. Typically, DEG are identified by univariate approaches such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) or Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) for processing cDNA microarrays, and differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution (DESeq) or Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression data in R (edgeR) for RNA-seq profiling.RESULTS:Here we present a new geometrical multivariate approach to identify DEG called the Characteristic Direction. We demonstrate that the Characteristic Direction method is significantly more sensitive than existing methods for identifying DEG in the context of transcription factor (TF) and drug perturbation responses over a large number of microarray experiments. We also benchmarked the Characteristic Direction method using synthetic data, as well as RNA-Seq data. A large collection of microarray expression data from TF perturbations (73 experiments) and drug perturbations (130 experiments) extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as an RNA-Seq study that profiled genome-wide gene expression and STAT3 DNA binding in two subtypes of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, were used for benchmarking the method using real data. ChIP-Seq data identifying DNA binding sites of the perturbed TFs, as well as known drug targets of the perturbing drugs, were used as prior knowledge silver-standard for validation. In all cases the Characteristic Direction DEG calling method outperformed other methods. We find that when drugs are applied to cells in various contexts, the proteins that interact with the drug-targets are differentially expressed and more of the corresponding genes are discovered by the Characteristic Direction method. In addition, we show that the Characteristic Direction conceptualization can be used to perform improved gene set enrichment analyses when compared with the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the hypergeometric test.CONCLUSIONS:The application of the Characteristic Direction method may shed new light on relevant biological mechanisms that would have remained undiscovered by the current state-of-the-art DEG methods. The method is freely accessible via various open source code implementations using four popular programming languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica, all available at: http://www.maayanlab.net/CD webcite.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray data analysis presents a significant challenge to researchers who are unable to use the powerful Bioconductor and its numerous tools due to their lack of knowledge of R language. Among the few existing software programs that offer a graphic user interface to Bioconductor packages, none have implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the accuracy and reliability issue of microarray data analysis due to the well known probe design problems associated with many widely used microarray chips. There is also a lack of tools that would expedite the functional analysis of microarray results.

FINDINGS: We present Microarray Я US, an R-based graphical user interface that implements over a dozen popular Bioconductor packages to offer researchers a streamlined workflow for routine differential microarray expression data analysis without the need to learn R language. In order to enable a more accurate analysis and interpretation of microarray data, we incorporated the latest custom probe re-definition and re-annotation for Affymetrix and Illumina chips. A versatile microarray results output utility tool was also implemented for easy and fast generation of input files for over 20 of the most widely used functional analysis software programs.

CONCLUSION: Coupled with a well-designed user interface, Microarray Я US leverages cutting edge Bioconductor packages for researchers with no knowledge in R language. It also enables a more reliable and accurate microarray data analysis and expedites downstream functional analysis of microarray results.},

abstract = {RIP1 and RIP3 kinases are central players in TNF-induced programmed necrosis. Here, we report that the RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) of RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the assembly of heterodimeric filamentous structures. The fibrils exhibit classical characteristics of $\beta$-amyloids, as shown by Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) binding, circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR. Structured amyloid cores are mapped in RIP1 and RIP3 that are flanked by regions of mobility. The endogenous RIP1/RIP3 complex isolated from necrotic cells binds ThT, is ultrastable, and has a fibrillar core structure, whereas necrosis is partially inhibited by ThT, CR, and another amyloid dye, HBX. Mutations in the RHIMs of RIP1 and RIP3 that are defective in the interaction compromise cluster formation, kinase activation, and programmed necrosis in vivo. The current study provides insight into the structural changes that occur when RIP kinases are triggered to execute different signaling outcomes and expands the realm of amyloids to complex formation and signaling.},

The crystal structure revealed a homodimer resembling that of bacterial RNase III but extended by a unique N-terminal domain, and it identified additional catalytic residues conserved throughout eukaryotic RNase III enzymes. Biochemical analyses showed that Dcr1 dimers bind cooperatively along the dsRNA substrate such that the distance between consecutive active sites determines the length of the siRNA products. Thus, unlike canonical Dicers, which successively remove siRNA duplexes from the dsRNA termini, budding-yeast Dicers initiate processing in the interior and work outward. The distinct mechanism of budding-yeast Dicers establishes a paradigm for natural molecular rulers and imparts substrate preferences with ramifications for biological function.},

annote = {RNAi у почкующихся дрожжей вообще и S. cerevisiae в частности

        
Кратенько повторить (для тех, кто забыл)

        
Отсутствие RNAi у дрожжей было обнаружено ещё до открытия RNAi. Честно говоря, если следить по статьям, всего на полтора месяца раньше, однако факт остаётся фактом. В 1998 клонировали AGO1
        A. thaliana и выяснили, что у дрожжей нет гомолога, хотя в других геномах (или просто среди последовательностей) есть. Потом выяснили, что Dicer{\&}{\#}039;а тоже нет. 
Поскольку S. cerevisiae — это модельный организм, быстренько решили, что у всех остальных почкующихся дрожжей RNAi тоже нет. Потом что-то аргонавтоподобное нашли у S. castellii, Candida albicans, Kluyveromyces polysporus. При этом Dicer{\&}{\#}039;а у них нет. (см. Weinberg, 2013)

        
Статья 2009 года: есть Dicer-like activity (что-то в экстрактах клеток S. castellii режет РНК), но нет домена Dicer. Поскольку получали 2nt 3{\&}{\#}039; overhangs, стали искать вообще любые RNase III. У S.cer один такой ген (RNT1). У S.cast. есть ещё один. Назвали DCR1. У мутантов dcr1delta действительно проблемы.
У S.pombe вообще всё хорошо и есть канонический Dicer (tandem RNaseIII domains, 2-3dsRBDs, PAZ, N-terminal helicase domain). DCR1: 2 dsRBDs, 1 RNaseIII. Возможно, это гомодимер? Возможно, это ещё и продукт дупликации части RNT1 (очень похоже)? Кстати, объясняет, почему не находили: он не гомолог Dicer. Возможно, это совпало с потерей настоящего Dicer. 
Dcr1 в E.coli и S.cer. Работает. Без специфических кофакторов, значит.
Выделили Ago1p вместе с РНК, которые он держал зубами. Там много Ty, Y{\&}{\#}039;, палиндромов и мало рРНК и тРНК.
Отсеквенировали полиА мРНК в нормальном штамме и делетанте по AGO1. Наиболее сильно изменены именно те гены, из которых шинкуется siRNA + ряд генов, экспрессия которых изменяется куда меньше. Это может быть ответ на отсутствие RNAi либо на ген устойчивости к канамицину / гигромицину.
Сделали репортерную конструкцию с GFP.
Добавление всего двух генов в cerevisiae ={\&}gt; путь восстановлен. Работает с GFP и URA3. 
Есть ли фенотип у делеции ago1 dcr1? Ага. Нестабильность плазмид. Видимо, давит Ty. Может быть, ещё и с вирусами связано.
взять оттуда картинку 1 и подумать о 2.

abstract = {Genome-scale datasets have been used extensively in model organisms to screen for specific candidates or to predict functions for uncharacterized genes. However, despite the availability of extensive knowledge in model organisms, the planning of genome-scale experiments in poorly studied species is still based on the intuition of experts or heuristic trials. We propose that computational and systematic approaches can be applied to drive the experiment planning process in poorly studied species based on available data and knowledge in closely related model organisms. In this paper, we suggest a computational strategy for recommending genome-scale experiments based on their capability to interrogate diverse biological processes to enable protein function assignment. To this end, we use the data-rich functional genomics compendium of the model organism to quantify the accuracy of each dataset in predicting each specific biological process and the overlap in such coverage between different datasets. Our approach uses an optimized combination of these quantifications to recommend an ordered list of experiments for accurately annotating most proteins in the poorly studied related organisms to most biological processes, as well as a set of experiments that target each specific biological process. The effectiveness of this experiment- planning system is demonstrated for two related yeast species: the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the comparatively poorly studied Saccharomyces bayanus. Our system recommended a set of S. bayanus experiments based on an S. cerevisiae microarray data compendium. In silico evaluations estimate that less than 10{\%} of the experiments could achieve similar functional coverage to the whole microarray compendium. This estimation was confirmed by performing the recommended experiments in S. bayanus, therefore significantly reducing the labor devoted to characterize the poorly studied genome. This experiment-planning framework could readily be adapted to the design of other types of large-scale experiments as well as other groups of organisms.},

abstract = {A recombinant yEGFP gene yeast strain necessary for the routine screening of estrogen activity in the chemical product of the environment was described. Two plasmids, one containing human estrogen receptor (hER) cDNA fused to the GPD gene promoter and another yEGFP inserted under the control of ERE, were constructed. The use of hER cDNA and the yEGFP reporter in the yeast cell sensor resulted in estrogenic chemical product-dependent light emission of yEGFP without additions owing its advantages: a simple and reagent-free measurement of GFP, and a non-toxic protein characteristic. The time needed for the optimal induction of light emission was 4h. The maximal fold induction of 8.80 over uninduced levels at the concentration of 10(-5)M of bisphenol A and 0.1 nM sensitivities for four different estrogenic chemicals tested were obtained. Five different chemicals which could not bind to hER did not cause an induction of yEGFP. This bioassay can be performed completely in 96-well plates. Thus, this test system can be used as a rapid screening system for the surveillance of estrogenic chemical products in the environment. The yEGFP assay is sensitive, reproducible, and cheap, which makes it highly suitable to be used as a high throughput system.},

abstract = {The discovery of fluorescent proteins has revolutionized experimental biology. Whereas the majority of fluorescent proteins have been identified from cnidarians, recently several fluorescent proteins have been isolated across the animal tree of life. Here we show that biofluorescence is not only phylogenetically widespread, but is also phenotypically variable across both cartilaginous and bony fishes, highlighting its evolutionary history and the possibility for discovery of numerous novel fluorescent proteins. Fish biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coral-reef lineages. We identified 16 orders, 50 families, 105 genera, and more than 180 species of biofluorescent fishes. We have also reconstructed our current understanding of the phylogenetic distribution of biofluorescence for ray-finned fishes. The presence of yellow long-pass intraocular filters in many biofluorescent fish lineages and the substantive color vision capabilities of coral-reef fishes suggest that they are capable of detecting fluoresced light. We present species-specific emission patterns among closely related species, indicating that biofluorescence potentially functions in intraspecific communication and evidence that fluorescence can be used for camouflage. This research provides insight into the distribution, evolution, and phenotypic variability of biofluorescence in marine lineages and examines the role this variation may play.},

abstract = {Fluorescence, the absorption and re-emission of photons with longer wavelengths, is one of those amazing phenomena of Nature. Its discovery and utilization had, and still has, a major impact on biological and biomedical research, since it enables researchers not just to visualize normal physiological processes with high temporal and spatial resolution, to detect multiple signals concomitantly, to track single molecules in vivo, to replace radioactive assays when possible, but also to shed light on many pathobiological processes underpinning disease states, which would otherwise not be possible. Compounds that exhibit fluorescence are commonly called fluorochromes or fluorophores and one of these fluorescent molecules in particular has significantly enabled life science research to gain new insights in virtually all its sub-disciplines: Green Fluorescent Protein. Because fluorescent proteins are synthesized in vivo, integration of fluorescent detection methods into the biological system via genetic techniques now became feasible. Currently fluorescent proteins are available that virtually span the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Concomitantly, fluorescence imaging techniques were developed, and often progress in one field fueled innovation in the other. Impressively, the properties of fluorescence were utilized to develop new assays and imaging modalities, ranging from energy transfer to image molecular interactions to imaging beyond the diffraction limit with super-resolution microscopy. Here, an overview is provided of recent developments in both fluorescence imaging and fluorochrome engineering, which together constitute the “fluorescence toolbox” in life science research.},

@article{Kumar2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a unique class of genes with intra-genic promoters and high transcriptional activity. The major contributors to the pol III transcriptome, tRNAs genes are found scattered on all chromosomes of yeast. A prototype tDNA of <150 bp length, is generally considered nucleosome-free while some pol III-transcribed genes have been shown to have nucleosome-positioning properties.

RESULTS: Using high resolution ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq methods, we found several unique features associated with nucleosome profiles on all tRNA genes of budding yeast, not seen on nucleosome-dense counterparts in fission yeast and resting human CD4+ T cells. The nucleosome-free region (NFR) on all but three yeast tDNAs is found bordered by an upstream (US) nucleosome strongly positioned at -140 bp position and a downstream (DS) nucleosome at variable positions with respect to the gene terminator. Perturbation in this nucleosomal arrangement interferes with the tRNA production. Three different chromatin remodelers generate and maintain the NFR by targeting different gene regions. Isw1 localizes to the gene body and makes it nucleosome-depleted, Isw2 maintains periodicity in the upstream nucleosomal array, while RSC targets the downstream nucleosome. Direct communication of pol III with RSC serves as a stress-sensory mechanism for these genes. In its absence, the downstream nucleosome moves towards the gene terminator. Levels of tRNAs from different families are found to vary considerably as different pol III levels are seen even on isogenes within a family. Pol III levels show negative correlation with the nucleosome occupancies on different genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Budding yeast tRNA genes maintain an open chromatin structure, which is not due to sequence-directed nucleosome positioning or high transcription activity of genes. Unlike 5' NFR on pol II-transcribed genes, the tDNA NFR, which facilitates tDNA transcription, results from action of chromatin remodeler Isw1, aided by Isw2 and RSC. The RSC-regulated nucleosome dynamics at the 3' gene-end serves as a novel regulatory mechanism for pol III transcription in vivo, probably by controlling terminator-dependent facilitated recycling of pol III. Salient features of yeast tDNA chromatin structure reported in this study can explain the basis of the novel non-transcriptional roles ascribed to tDNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from natural settings form structured biofilm colonies that are equipped with intricate protective mechanisms. These wild strains are able to reprogram themselves with a certain frequency during cultivation in plentiful laboratory conditions. The resulting domesticated strains switch off certain protective mechanisms and form smooth colonies that resemble those of common laboratory strains.

RESULTS: Here, we show that domestication can be reversed when a domesticated strain is challenged by various adverse conditions; the resulting feral strain restores its ability to form structured biofilm colonies. Phenotypic, microscopic and transcriptomic analyses show that phenotypic transition is a complex process that affects various aspects of feral strain physiology; it leads to a phenotype that resembles the original wild strain in some aspects and the domesticated derivative in others. We specify the genetic determinants that are likely involved in the formation of a structured biofilm colonies. In addition to FLO11, these determinants include genes that affect the cell wall and membrane composition. We also identify changes occurring during phenotypic transitions that affect other properties of phenotypic strain-variants, such as resistance to the impact of environmental stress. Here we document the regulatory role of the histone deacetylase Hda1p in developing such a resistance.

CONCLUSIONS: We provide detailed analysis of transcriptomic and phenotypic modulations of three related S. cerevisiae strains that arose by phenotypic switching under diverse environmental conditions. We identify changes specifically related to a strain's ability to create complex structured colonies; we also show that other changes, such as genome rearrangement(s), are unrelated to this ability. Finally, we identify the importance of histone deacetylase Hda1p in strain resistance to stresses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene regulation underlies fungal physiology and therefore is a major factor in fungal biodiversity. Analysis of genome sequences has revealed a large number of putative transcription factors in most fungal genomes. The presence of fungal orthologs for individual regulators has been analysed and appears to be highly variable with some regulators widely conserved and others showing narrow distribution. Although genome-scale transcription factor surveys have been performed before, no global study into the prevalence of specific regulators across the fungal kingdom has been presented.

RESULTS: In this study we have analysed the number of members for 37 regulator classes in 77 ascomycete and 31 basidiomycete fungal genomes and revealed significant differences between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. In addition, we determined the presence of 64 regulators characterised in ascomycetes across these 108 genomes. This demonstrated that overall the highest presence of orthologs is in the filamentous ascomycetes. A significant number of regulators lacked orthologs in the ascomycete yeasts and the basidiomycetes. Conversely, of seven basidiomycete regulators included in the study, only one had orthologs in ascomycetes.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a significant difference in the regulatory repertoire of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi, at the level of both regulator class and individual regulator. This suggests that the current regulatory systems of these fungi have been mainly developed after the two phyla diverged. Most regulators detected in both phyla are involved in central functions of fungal physiology and therefore were likely already present in the ancestor of the two phyla.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is an important defence against viruses and transposable elements (TEs). RNAi not only protects against viruses by degrading viral RNA, but hosts and viruses can also use RNAi to manipulate each other's gene expression, and hosts can encode microRNAs that target viral sequences. In response, viruses have evolved a myriad of adaptations to suppress and evade RNAi. RNAi can also protect cells against TEs, both by degrading TE transcripts and by preventing TE expression through heterochromatin formation. The aim of our review is to summarize and evaluate the current data on the evolution of these RNAi defence mechanisms. To this end, we also extend a previous analysis of the evolution of genes of the RNAi pathways. Strikingly, we find that antiviral RNAi genes, anti-TE RNAi genes and viral suppressors of RNAi all evolve rapidly, suggestive of an evolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites. Over longer time scales, key RNAi genes are repeatedly duplicated or lost across the metazoan phylogeny, with important implications for RNAi as an immune defence.},

Recently, our understanding of gene expression has been dramatically challenged by the identification of large and diverse populations of novel ncRNAs in the eukaryotic genomes surveyed thus far. Studies carried out using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that at least some coding genes are regulated by these novel ncRNAs. S. cerevisiae lacks RNA interference (RNAi) and, thus, provides an ideal system for studying the RNAi-independent mechanisms of ncRNA-based gene regulation. The current picture of gene regulation is one of great unknowns, in which the transcriptional environment surrounding a given locus may have as much to do with its regulation as its DNA sequence or local chromatin structure. Drawing on the recent research in S. cerevisiae and other organisms, this review will discuss the identification of ncRNAs, their origins and processing, and several models that incorporate ncRNAs into the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure.},

In this review, we describe the diversity of RNAi mechanisms found in the fungi, highlighting recent work in Neurospora, S. pombe, and Cryptococcus.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytosolic Hsp70 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is involved in responding to a variety of cellular stresses. A major function of Hsp70 is to prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions and preventing the accumulation of amorphous aggregates. To gain further insight into the functional redundancy and specialisation of the highly homologous yeast Hsp70-Ssa family we expressed each of the individual Ssa proteins as the sole source of Hsp70 in the cell and assessed phenotypic differences in prion propagation and stress resistance. Additionally we also analysed the global gene expression patterns in yeast strains expressing individual Ssa proteins, using microarray and RT-qPCR analysis. RESULTS: We confirm and extend previous studies demonstrating that cells expressing different Hsp70-Ssa isoforms vary in their ability to propagate the yeast [PSI+] prion, with Ssa3 being the most proficient. Of the four Ssa family members the heat inducible isoforms are more proficient in acquiring thermotolerance and we show a greater requirement than was previously thought, for cellular processes in addition to the traditional Hsp104 protein disaggregase machinery, in acquiring such thermotolerance. Cells expressing different Hsp70-Ssa isoforms also display differences in phenotypic response to exposure to cell wall damaging and oxidative stress agents, again with the heat inducible isoforms providing better protection than constitutive isoforms. We assessed global transcriptome profiles for cells expressing individual Hsp70-Ssa isoforms as the sole source of cytosolic Hsp70, and identified a significant difference in cellular gene expression between these strains. Differences in gene expression profiles provide a rationale for some phenotypic differences we observed in this study. We also demonstrate a high degree of correlation between microarray data and RT-qPCR analysis for a selection of genes. CONCLUSIONS: The Hsp70-Ssa family provide both redundant and variant-specific functions within the yeast cell. Yeast cells expressing individual members of the Hsp70-Ssa family as the sole source of Ssa protein display differences in global gene expression profiles. These changes in global gene expression may contribute significantly to the phenotypic differences observed between the Hsp70-Ssa family members.},
annote = {{\#}background
 In yeast, the hsp70 gene family comprises of fourteen genes, whose protein products share a sequence similarity of approximately 50-96{\%}. Of these, nine are cytosolic and five are compartmental specific. The major cytosolic Hsp70 family in yeast is the Hsp70-Ssa (Stress Seventy sub-family A), which consists of four members of Ssa (Ssa1-4). 

        
 Constitutively expressed Ssa1 and Ssa2 are 97{\%} identical to each other and under optimal conditions Ssa2 is approximately fourfold more abundant than Ssa1 and depletion of Ssa2 induces expression of Ssa1, maintaining overall Hsp70 abundance. The heat-inducible Ssa3 and Ssa4 are 87{\%} identical to each other and share an identity of 80{\%} with Ssa1/2 [21]

        
 Overexpression of Ssa1 but not Ssa2, can cure [URE3] while depleting Ssa1 weakens [PSI+] but not [URE3] [26,27]. The functional difference in Ssa1 or 2 in terms of prion propagation were found to be due to a single amino acid difference in the ATPase of these highly homologous proteins [28].

 После обработки ГГХ эффект пропадает. Это связано с Hsp104.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolution of gene expression is a challenging problem in evolutionary biology, for which accurate, well-calibrated measurements and methods are crucial.

RESULTS: We quantified gene expression with whole-transcriptome sequencing in four diploid, prototrophic strains of Saccharomyces species grown under the same condition to investigate the evolution of gene expression. We found that variation in expression is gene-dependent with large variations in each gene's expression between replicates of the same species. This confounds the identification of genes differentially expressed across species. To address this, we developed a statistical approach to establish significance bounds for inter-species differential expression in RNA-Seq data based on the variance measured across biological replicates. This metric estimates the combined effects of technical and environmental variance, as well as Poisson sampling noise by isolating each component. Despite a paucity of large expression changes, we found a strong correlation between the variance of gene expression change and species divergence (R² = 0.90).

CONCLUSION: We provide an improved methodology for measuring gene expression changes in evolutionary diverged species using RNA Seq, where experimental artifacts can mimic evolutionary effects.GEO Accession Number: GSE32679.},

The joint filtering gene selection criterion based on regularized statistics has a curved discriminant line in the volcano plot, as compared to the two perpendicular lines for the "double filtering" criterion. This review attempts to provide a unifying framework for discussions on alternative measures of differential expression, improved methods for estimating variance, and visual display of a microarray analysis result.

We report on the results of a survey encompassing 78 of such tools, of which 22 were inspected in detail and seven were tested hands-on. We report on our experiences with a focus on completeness of functionality, ease-of-use, and necessary effort for installation and maintenance. Thereby, our survey provides a valuable guideline for any project considering the use of a microarray data management system. It reveals which tasks are covered by mature tools and also shows that important requirements, especially in the area of integrated analysis of different experimental data, are not yet met satisfyingly by existing systems.},

abstract = {The wide application of high-throughput transcriptomics using microarrays has generated a plethora of technical platforms, data repositories, and sophisticated statistical analysis methods, leaving the individual scientist with the problem of choosing the appropriate approach to address a biological question. Several software applications that provide a rich environment for microarray analysis and data storage are available (e.g. GeneSpring, EMMA2), but these are mostly commercial or require an advanced informatics infrastructure. There is a need for a noncommercial, easy-to-use graphical application that aids the lab researcher to find the proper method to analyze microarray data, without this requiring expert understanding of the complex underlying statistics, or programming skills. We have developed Robin, a Java-based graphical wizard application that harnesses the advanced statistical analysis functions of the R/BioConductor project. Robin implements streamlined workflows that guide the user through all steps of two-color, single-color, or Affymetrix microarray analysis. It provides functions for thorough quality assessment of the data and automatically generates warnings to notify the user of potential outliers, low-quality chips, or low statistical power. The results are generated in a standard format that allows ready use with both specialized analysis tools like MapMan and PageMan and generic spreadsheet applications. To further improve user friendliness, Robin includes both integrated help and comprehensive external documentation. To demonstrate the statistical power and ease of use of the workflows in Robin, we present a case study in which we apply Robin to analyze a two-color microarray experiment comparing gene expression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves, flowers, and roots.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are self-templating protein-based mechanisms of inheritance whose conformational changes lead to the acquisition of diverse new phenotypes. The best studied of these is the prion domain (NM) of Sup35, which forms an amyloid that can adopt several distinct conformations (strains) that produce distinct phenotypes. Using magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide a detailed look at the dynamic properties of these forms over a broad range of timescales. We establish that different prion strains have distinct amyloid structures, with many side chains in different chemical environments. Surprisingly, the prion strain with a larger fraction of rigid residues also has a larger fraction of highly mobile residues. Differences in mobility correlate with differences in interaction with the prion-partitioning factor Hsp104 in vivo, perhaps explaining strain-specific differences in inheritance.},

abstract = {RNA surveillance systems function at critical steps during the formation and function of RNA molecules in all organisms. The RNA exosome plays a central role in RNA surveillance by processing and degrading RNA molecules in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The exosome functions as a complex of proteins composed of a nine-member core and two ribonucleases. The identity of the molecular determinants of exosome RNA substrate specificity remains an important unsolved aspect of RNA surveillance. In the nucleus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TRAMP complexes recognize and polyadenylate RNAs, which enhances RNA degradation by the exosome and may contribute to its specificity. TRAMPs contain either of two putative RNA-binding factors called Air proteins. Previous studies suggested that these proteins function interchangeably in targeting the poly(A)-polymerase activity of TRAMPs to RNAs. Experiments reported here show that the Air proteins govern separable functions. Phenotypic analysis and RNA deep-sequencing results from air mutants reveal specific requirements for each Air protein in the regulation of the levels of noncoding and coding RNAs. Loss of these regulatory functions results in specific metabolic and plasmid inheritance defects. These findings reveal differential functions for Air proteins in RNA metabolism and indicate that they control the substrate specificity of the RNA exosome.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated by oxygen are of considerable interest from basic science and therapeutic perspectives. Using mass spectrometric analyses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes, we found that the amino acid residue in closest proximity to the decoding center, Pro-64 of the 40S subunit ribosomal protein Rps23p (RPS23 Pro-62 in humans) undergoes posttranslational hydroxylation. We identify RPS23 hydroxylases as a highly conserved eukaryotic subfamily of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases; their catalytic domain is closely related to transcription factor prolyl trans-4-hydroxylases that act as oxygen sensors in the hypoxic response in animals. The RPS23 hydroxylases in S. cerevisiae (Tpa1p), Schizosaccharomyces pombe and green algae catalyze an unprecedented dihydroxylation modification. This observation contrasts with higher eukaryotes, where RPS23 is monohydroxylated; the human Tpa1p homolog OGFOD1 catalyzes prolyl trans-3-hydroxylation. TPA1 deletion modulates termination efficiency up to ∼10-fold, including of pathophysiologically relevant sequences; we reveal Rps23p hydroxylation as its molecular basis. In contrast to most previously characterized accuracy modulators, including antibiotics and the prion state of the S. cerevisiae translation termination factor eRF3, Rps23p hydroxylation can either increase or decrease translational accuracy in a stop codon context-dependent manner. We identify conditions where Rps23p hydroxylation status determines viability as a consequence of nonsense codon suppression. The results reveal a direct link between oxygenase catalysis and the regulation of gene expression at the translational level. They will also aid in the development of small molecules altering translational accuracy for the treatment of genetic diseases linked to nonsense mutations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Systems biology demands the use of several point of views to get a more comprehensive understanding of biological problems. This usually leads to take into account different data regarding the problem at hand, but it also has to do with using different perspectives of the same data. This multifaceted aspect of systems biology often requires the use of several tools, and it is often hard to get a seamless integration of all of them, which would help the analyst to have an interactive discourse with the data.

RESULTS: Focusing on expression profiling, BicOverlapper 2.0 visualizes the most relevant aspects of the analysis, including expression data, profiling analysis results and functional annotation. It also integrates several state-of-the-art numerical methods, such as differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment or biclustering.

abstract = {Prion formation involves the conversion of proteins from a soluble form into an infectious amyloid form. Most yeast prion proteins contain glutamine/asparagine-rich regions that are responsible for prion aggregation. Prion formation by these domains is driven primarily by amino acid composition, not primary sequence, yet there is a surprising disconnect between the amino acids thought to have the highest aggregation propensity and those that are actually found in yeast prion domains. Specifically, a recent mutagenic screen suggested that both aromatic and non-aromatic hydrophobic residues strongly promote prion formation. However, while aromatic residues are common in yeast prion domains, non-aromatic hydrophobic residues are strongly under-represented. Here, we directly test the effects of hydrophobic and aromatic residues on prion formation. Remarkably, we found that insertion of as few as two hydrophobic residues resulted in a multiple orders-of-magnitude increase in prion formation, and significant acceleration of in vitro amyloid formation. Thus, insertion or deletion of hydrophobic residues provides a simple tool to control the prion activity of a protein. These data, combined with bioinformatics analysis, suggest a limit on the number of strongly prion-promoting residues tolerated in glutamine/asparagine-rich domains. This limit may explain the under-representation of non-aromatic hydrophobic residues in yeast prion domains. Prion activity requires not only that a protein be able to form prion fibers, but also that these fibers be cleaved to generate new independently-segregating aggregates to offset dilution by cell division. Recent studies suggest that aromatic residues, but not non-aromatic hydrophobic residues, support the fiber cleavage step. Therefore, we propose that while both aromatic and non-aromatic hydrophobic residues promote prion formation, aromatic residues are favored in yeast prion domains because they serve a dual function, promoting both prion formation and chaperone-dependent prion propagation.},

+ DIANA (или уже упоминалось?)

        
Although expanded poly-glutamine tracts show high aggregation propensity, they do not propagate efficiently as prions in yeast because they are poorly fragmented by the chaperone machinery [32]; such fragmentation is required to maintain prions over multiple generations of cell division. Alexandrov et al. recently showed that insertion of aromatic residues into poly-Q tracts promotes fiber fragmentation, but that non-aromatic hydrophobic residues do not exert the same positive effect [33].

        
The first 40 amino acids are highly enriched in Q/N residues and are required for prion nucleation and fiber growth, while amino acids 40–114 are thought to be primarily involved in prion maintenance [34], [44], [45], [46], [47].

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN) from a collection of gene expression data has many potential applications, from the elucidation of complex biological processes to the identification of potential drug targets. It is however a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methods reach limited accuracy. RESULTS: In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem and investigate the performance of a popular feature selection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stability selection, for that purpose. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique for stability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection with LARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (for Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation with Stability Selection), was ranked among the top GRN inference methods in the DREAM5 gene network inference challenge. In particular, TIGRESS was evaluated to be the best linear regression-based method in the challenge. We investigate in depth the influence of the various parameters of the method, and show that a fine parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance for GRN inference, in both directed and undirected settings. CONCLUSIONS: TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data, including both in silico and in vivo (E. coli and S. cerevisiae) networks. This study confirms the potential of feature selection techniques for GRN inference. Code and data are available on http://cbio.ensmp.fr/tigress. Moreover, TIGRESS can be run online through the GenePattern platform (GP-DREAM, http://dream.broadinstitute.org).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In the past decade, the field of molecular biology has become increasingly quantitative; rapid development of new technologies enables researchers to investigate and address fundamental issues quickly and in an efficient manner which were once impossible. Among these technologies, DNA microarray provides methodology for many applications such as gene discovery, diseases diagnosis, drug development and toxicological research and it has been used increasingly since it first emerged. Multiple tools have been developed to interpret the high-throughput data produced by microarrays. However, many times, less consideration has been given to the fact that an extensive and effective interpretation requires close interplay between the bioinformaticians who analyze the data and the biologists who generate it. To bridge this gap and to simplify the usability of such tools we developed Eureka-DMA -- an easy-to-operate graphical user interface that allows bioinformaticians and bench-biologists alike to initiate analyses as well as to investigate the data produced by DNA microarrays.RESULTS:In this paper, we describe Eureka-DMA, a user-friendly software that comprises a set of methods for the interpretation of gene expression arrays. Eureka-DMA includes methods for the identification of genes with differential expression between conditions; it searches for enriched pathways and gene ontology terms and combines them with other relevant features. It thus enables the full understanding of the data for following testing as well as generating new hypotheses. Here we show two analyses, demonstrating examples of how Eureka-DMA can be used and its capability to produce relevant and reliable results.CONCLUSIONS:We have integrated several elementary expression analysis tools to provide a unified interface for their implementation. Eureka-DMA's simple graphical user interface provides effective and efficient framework in which the investigator has the full set of tools for the visualization and interpretation of the data with the option of exporting the analysis results for later use in other platforms.

Ribosome profiling is an emerging technique that uses deep sequencing to monitor in vivo translation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first objective of a DNA microarray experiment is typically to generate a list of genes or probes that are found to be differentially expressed or represented (in the case of comparative genomic hybridizations and/or copy number variation) between two conditions or strains. Rank Products analysis comprises a robust algorithm for deriving such lists from microarray experiments that comprise small numbers of replicates, for example, less than the number required for the commonly used t-test. Currently, users wishing to apply Rank Products analysis to their own microarray data sets have been restricted to the use of command line-based software which can limit its usage within the biological community. FINDINGS: Here we have developed a web interface to existing Rank Products analysis tools allowing users to quickly process their data in an intuitive and step-wise manner to obtain the respective Rank Product or Rank Sum, probability of false prediction and p-values in a downloadable file. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive Rank Products analysis tool RankProdIt, for analysis of any data set containing measurements for multiple replicated conditions, is available at: http://strep-microarray.sbs.surrey.ac.uk/RankProducts.},

abstract = {Sup35 protein (Sup35p), or eukaryotic peptide chain release factor GTP binding subunit (eRF3), is a well-known yeast prion responsible for the characteristic [PSI(+)] trait. N- and M-domains of this protein have been the foci of intensive research due to their importance for the prion formation. Sup35p C-terminal domain (Sup35pC) is essential for translation termination and cell viability. Deletion of Sup35pC was shown to lead to malformation of cells during mitosis. In this study we confirm that Sup35pC domain possesses high sequence and structural similarity to the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1-$\alpha$ (eEF1A) from yeast and show that its sequence is conserved across different species including human. Because cell malformation during mitosis could be due to the deregulation of cytoskeleton formation, and since a Sup35 paralog eEF1A is known to act as an actin modulating protein, we focused on establishing of the relationships between the Sup35pC and modulation of the cytoskeleton formation. We found 104 co-partners between Sup35pC and EF1A of S. cerevisiae, and 18 partners of human ERF3A. Based on the analysis of known and modeled structures of some effectors and partners we found possible protein-protein interactions. Based on our study, we propose that Sup35pC may serve as actin modulator during mitosis.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic releasing factor eRF3 is a multifunctional protein that plays pivotal roles in translation termination as well as the initiation of mRNA decay. eRF3 also functions in the regulation of apoptosis; eRF3 is cleaved at Ala73 by an as yet unidentified protease into processed isoform of eRF3 (p-eRF3), which interacts with the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). The binding of p-eRF3 with IAPs leads to the release of active caspases from IAPs, which promotes apoptosis. Although full-length eRF3 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, p-eRF3 localizes in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. We here focused on the role of p-eRF3 in the nucleus. We identified leptomycin-sensitive nuclear export signal (NES) at amino acid residues 61-71 immediately upstream of the cleavage site Ala73. Thus, the proteolytic cleavage of eRF3 into p-eRF3 leads to release an amino-terminal fragment containing NES to allow the relocalization of eRF3 into the nucleus. Consistent with this, p-eRF3 more strongly interacted with the nuclear ARF tumor suppressor than full-length eRF3. These results suggest that while p-eRF3 interacts with IAPs to promote apoptosis in the cytoplasm, p-eRF3 also has some roles in regulating cell death in the nucleus.},

abstract = {Grx3 and Grx4 are two monothiol glutaredoxins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have previously been characterized as regulators of Aft1 localization and therefore of iron homeostasis. In this study, we present data showing that both Grx3 and Grx4 have new roles in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and in cellular defenses against oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The Grx4 protein plays a unique role in the maintenance of actin cable integrity, which is independent of its role in the transcriptional regulation of Aft1. Grx3 plays an additive and redundant role, in combination with Grx4, in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, both under normal conditions and in response to external oxidative stress. Each Grx3 and Grx4 protein contains a thioredoxin domain sequence (Trx), followed by a glutaredoxin domain (Grx). We performed functional analyses of each of the two domains and characterized different functions for them. Each of the two Grx domains plays a role in ROS detoxification and cell viability. However, the Trx domain of each Grx4 and Grx3 protein acts independently of its respective Grx domain in a novel function that involves the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, which also determines cell resistance against oxidative conditions. Finally, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that Grx4 behaves as an antioxidant protein increasing cell survival under conditions of oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Two transcriptional activators, Aft1 and Aft2, regulate iron homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors induce the expression of iron regulon genes in iron-deficient yeast but are inactivated in iron-replete cells. Iron inhibition of Aft1/Aft2 is abrogated in cells defective for Fe-S cluster biogenesis within the mitochondrial matrix (Chen, O. S., Crisp, R. J., Valachovic, M., Bard, M., Winge, D. R., and Kaplan, J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 29513-29518). To determine whether iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 requires the function of the mitochondrial Fe-S export and cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly systems, we evaluated the expression of the iron regulon in cells depleted of glutathione and in cells depleted of Atm1, Nar1, Cfd1, and Nbp35. The iron regulon is induced in cells depleted of Atm1 with Aft1 largely responsible for the induced gene expression. Aft2 is activated at a later time in Atm1-depleted cells. Likewise, the iron regulon is induced in cells depleted of glutathione. In contrast, repression of NAR1, CFD1, or NBP35 fails to induce the iron regulon despite strong inhibition of cytosolic/nuclear Fe-S protein assembly. Thus, iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 is not linked to the maturation of cytosolic/nuclear Fe-S proteins, but the mitochondrial inner membrane transporter Atm1 is important to transport the inhibitory signal. Although Aft1 and Aft2 sense a signal emanating from the Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathway, there is no indication that the proteins are inhibited by direct binding of an Fe-S cluster.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.

CONTENT: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.

SUMMARY: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

abstract = {The outer cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as the interface with the surrounding environment and directly affects cell-cell and cell-surface interactions. Many of these interactions are facilitated by specific adhesins that belong to the Flo protein family. Flo mannoproteins have been implicated in phenotypes such as flocculation, substrate adhesion, biofilm formation, and pseudohyphal growth. Genetic data strongly suggest that individual Flo proteins are responsible for many specific cellular adhesion phenotypes. However, it remains unclear whether such phenotypes are determined solely by the nature of the expressed FLO genes or rather as the result of a combination of FLO gene expression and other cell wall properties and cell wall proteins. Mss11 has been shown to be a central element of FLO1 and FLO11 gene regulation and acts together with the cAMP-PKA-dependent transcription factor Flo8. Here we use genome-wide transcription analysis to identify genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by Mss11. Interestingly, many of these genes encode cell wall mannoproteins, in particular, members of the TIR and DAN families. To examine whether these genes play a role in the adhesion properties associated with Mss11 expression, we assessed deletion mutants of these genes in wild-type and flo11$\Delta$ genetic backgrounds. This analysis shows that only FLO genes, in particular FLO1/10/11, appear to significantly impact on such phenotypes. Thus adhesion-related phenotypes are primarily dependent on the balance of FLO gene expression.},

abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a favorite organism for pioneering studies on nutrient-sensing and signaling mechanisms. Many specific nutrient responses have been elucidated in great detail. This has led to important new concepts and insight into nutrient-controlled cellular regulation. Major highlights include the central role of the Snf1 protein kinase in the glucose repression pathway, galactose induction, the discovery of a G-protein-coupled receptor system, and role of Ras in glucose-induced cAMP signaling, the role of the protein synthesis initiation machinery in general control of nitrogen metabolism, the cyclin-controlled protein kinase Pho85 in phosphate regulation, nitrogen catabolite repression and the nitrogen-sensing target of rapamycin pathway, and the discovery of transporter-like proteins acting as nutrient sensors. In addition, a number of cellular targets, like carbohydrate stores, stress tolerance, and ribosomal gene expression, are controlled by the presence of multiple nutrients. The protein kinase A signaling pathway plays a major role in this general nutrient response. It has led to the discovery of nutrient transceptors (transporter receptors) as nutrient sensors. Major shortcomings in our knowledge are the relationship between rapid and steady-state nutrient signaling, the role of metabolic intermediates in intracellular nutrient sensing, and the identity of the nutrient sensors controlling cellular growth.},

abstract = {Aft1p is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that plays a central role in the regulation of iron metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aft1p is regulated by accelerated nuclear export in the presence of iron, mediated by Msn5p. However, the transcriptional activity of Aft1p is suppressed under iron-replete conditions in the $\Delta$msn5 strain, although Aft1p remains in the nucleus. Aft1p dissociates from its target promoters under iron-replete conditions due to an interaction between Aft1p and the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx3p or Grx4p (Grx3/4p). The binding of Grx3/4p to Aft1p is induced by iron repletion and requires binding of an iron-sulfur cluster to Grx3/4p. The mitochondrial transporter Atm1p, which has been implicated in the export of iron-sulfur clusters and related molecules, is required not only for iron binding to Grx3p but also for dissociation of Aft1p from its target promoters. These results suggest that iron binding to Grx3p (and presumably Grx4p) is a prerequisite for the suppression of Aft1p. Since Atm1p plays crucial roles in the delivery of iron-sulfur clusters from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and nucleus, these results support the previous observations that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery is involved in cellular iron sensing.},

abstract = {Microarray platforms require analytical pipelines with modules for data pre-processing including data normalization, statistical analysis for identification of differentially expressed genes, cluster analysis, and functional annotation. We previously developed the Automated Microarray Data Analysis (AMDA, version 2.3.5) pipeline to process Affymetrix 3' IVT GeneChips. The availability of newer technologies that demand open-source tools for microarray data analysis has impelled us to develop an updated multi-platform version, AMDA 2.13. It includes additional quality control metrics, annotation-driven (annotation grade of Affymetrix NetAffx) and signal-driven (Inter-Quartile Range) gene filtering, and approaches to experimental design. To enhance understanding of biological data, differentially expressed genes have been mapped into KEGG pathways. Finally, a more stable and user-friendly interface was designed to integrate the requirements for different platforms. AMDA 2.13 allows the analysis of Affymetrix (cartridges and plates) and whole transcript probe design (Gene 1.0/1.1 ST and Exon 1.0 ST GeneChips), Illumina Bead Arrays, and one-channel Agilent 4×44 arrays. Relative to early versions, it supports various experimental designs and delivers more insightful biological understanding and up-to-date annotations.},

abstract = {When grown in continuous culture, budding yeast cells tend to synchronize their respiratory activity to form a stable oscillation that percolates throughout cellular physiology and involves the majority of the protein-coding transcriptome. Oscillations in batch culture and at single cell level support the idea that these dynamics constitute a general growth principle. The precise molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the oscillation remain elusive. Fourier analysis of transcriptome time series datasets from two different oscillation periods (0.7 h and 5 h) reveals seven distinct co-expression clusters common to both systems (34{\%} of all yeast ORF), which consolidate into two superclusters when correlated with a compilation of 1,327 unrelated transcriptome datasets. These superclusters encode for cell growth and anabolism during the phase of high, and mitochondrial growth, catabolism and stress response during the phase of low oxygen uptake. The promoters of each cluster are characterized by different nucleotide contents, promoter nucleosome configurations, and dependence on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. We show that the ATP:ADP ratio oscillates, compatible with alternating metabolic activity of the two superclusters and differential feedback on their transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive (Isw2) types of promoter structure remodeling. We propose a novel feedback mechanism, where the energetic state of the cell, reflected in the ATP:ADP ratio, gates the transcription of large, but functionally coherent groups of genes via differential effects of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling machineries. Besides providing a mechanistic hypothesis for the delayed negative feedback that results in the oscillatory phenotype, this mechanism may underpin the continuous adaptation of growth to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The ribosome biogenesis pathway constitutes one of the major metabolic obligations for a dividing yeast cell and it depends upon the activity of hundreds of gene products to produce the necessary rRNA and ribosomal protein components. Previously, we reported that a set of 65 S. cerevisiae genes that function in the rRNA biosynthesis pathway are transcriptionally co-regulated as cells pass through a variety of physiological transitions. By analysing multiple microarray-based transcriptional datasets, we have extended that study and now suggest that the ribosomal and rRNA biosynthesis regulon contains over 200 genes. This regulon is distinct from the set of ribosomal protein genes, and the promoters of the expanded RRB gene set are highly enriched for the PAC and RRPE motifs. Since a similar pattern of organization and gene regulation can be recognized in C. albicans, the RRB regulon appears to be a conserved, extensive, and metabolically important group of genes.},

abstract = {TORC1 is a conserved multisubunit kinase complex that regulates many aspects of eukaryotic growth including the biosynthesis of ribosomes. The TOR protein kinase resident in TORC1 is responsive to environmental cues and is potently inhibited by the natural product rapamycin. Recent characterization of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteome in yeast has yielded insights into how TORC1 regulates growth. Here, we show that Sch9, an AGC family kinase and direct substrate of TORC1, promotes ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) and ribosomal protein (RP) gene expression via direct inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressors Stb3, Dot6 and Tod6. Deletion of STB3, DOT6 and TOD6 partially bypasses the growth and cell size defects of an sch9 strain and reveals interdependent regulation of both Ribi and RP gene expression, and other aspects of Ribi. Dephosphorylation of Stb3, Dot6 and Tod6 enables recruitment of the RPD3L histone deacetylase complex to repress Ribi/RP gene promoters. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that Sch9 is a master regulator of ribosome biogenesis through the control of Ribi, RP, ribosomal RNA and tRNA gene transcription.},

TORC1 действует на RNAPIII через Sch9, который осуществляет ингибирующее фосфорилирование Maf1, в свою очередь репрессирующий RNAPIII. Первую полимеразу TOR тоже может регулировать через Sch9, а может и независимо (через Rrn3. Активность второй полимеразы TORC регулирует по отношению к генам RP и Ribi, по крайней мере частично через Sch9.

abstract = {Microarrays were one of the first technologies of the genomic revolution to gain widespread adoption, rapidly expanding from a cottage industry to the source of thousands of experimental results. They were one of the first assays for which data repositories and metadata were standardized and researchers were required by many journals to make published data publicly available. Microarrays provide high-throughput insights into the biological functions of genes and gene products; however, they also present a "curse of dimensionality," whereby the availability of many gene expression measurements in few samples make it challenging to distinguish noise from true biological signal. All of these factors argue for integrative approaches to microarray data analysis, which combine data from multiple experiments to increase sample size, avoid laboratory-specific bias, and enable new biological insights not possible from a single experiment. Here, we discuss several approaches to integrative microarray analysis for a diverse range of applications, including biomarker discovery, gene function and interaction prediction, and regulatory network inference. We also show how, by integrating large microarray compendia with diverse genomic data types, more nuanced biological hypotheses can be explored computationally. This chapter provides overviews and brief descriptions of each of these approaches to microarray integration.},

@article{Langfelder2013,
abstract = {Since hub nodes have been found to play important roles in many networks, highly connected hub genes are expected to play an important role in biology as well. However, the empirical evidence remains ambiguous. An open question is whether (or when) hub gene selection leads to more meaningful gene lists than a standard statistical analysis based on significance testing when analyzing genomic data sets (e.g., gene expression or DNA methylation data). Here we address this question for the special case when multiple genomic data sets are available. This is of great practical importance since for many research questions multiple data sets are publicly available. In this case, the data analyst can decide between a standard statistical approach (e.g., based on meta-analysis) and a co-expression network analysis approach that selects intramodular hubs in consensus modules. We assess the performance of these two types of approaches according to two criteria. The first criterion evaluates the biological insights gained and is relevant in basic research. The second criterion evaluates the validation success (reproducibility) in independent data sets and often applies in clinical diagnostic or prognostic applications. We compare meta-analysis with consensus network analysis based on weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) in three comprehensive and unbiased empirical studies: (1) Finding genes predictive of lung cancer survival, (2) finding methylation markers related to age, and (3) finding mouse genes related to total cholesterol. The results demonstrate that intramodular hub gene status with respect to consensus modules is more useful than a meta-analysis p-value when identifying biologically meaningful gene lists (reflecting criterion 1). However, standard meta-analysis methods perform as good as (if not better than) a consensus network approach in terms of validation success (criterion 2). The article also reports a comparison of meta-analysis techniques applied to gene expression data and presents novel R functions for carrying out consensus network analysis, network based screening, and meta analysis.},

The new notation presents 'Domain expansion' for proteins and RNAs, 'Virtual reaction and nodes' that are responsible for illustrating domain-based interaction and 'InnerLink' that links real complex nodes to virtual nodes to illustrate the exact components of the real complex. A modular box is also presented that packs related reactions as a module or a subnetwork, which gives CADLIVE a capability to draw biochemical maps in a hierarchical modular architecture. Furthermore, we developed a pathway search module for virtual knockout mutants as a built-in application of CADLIVE. This module analyzes gene function in the same way as molecular genetics, which simulates a change in mutant phenotypes or confirms the validity of the network map. The extended CADLIVE with the newly proposed notation is demonstrated to be feasible for computational simulation and analysis.},

We also replicated the analysis using differential coexpression. We found that agreement of differential expression is primarily dictated by the microarray platform, while differential coexpression requires large sample sizes. Two studies using different differential expression metrics may show no agreement, even if they agree strongly using the same metric. Our analysis provides practical recommendations for gene (co)expression analysis.},

abstract = {Transcription factor (TF) perturbation experiments give valuable insights into gene regulation. Genome-scale evidence from microarray measurements may be used to identify regulatory interactions between TFs and targets. Recently, Hu and colleagues published a comprehensive study covering 269 TF knockout mutants for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the information that can be extracted from this valuable dataset is limited by the method employed to process the microarray data. Here, we present a reanalysis of the original data using improved statistical techniques freely available from the BioConductor project. We identify over 100,000 differentially expressed genes-nine times the total reported by Hu et al. We validate the biological significance of these genes by assessing their functions, the occurrence of upstream TF-binding sites, and the prevalence of protein-protein interactions. The reanalysed dataset outperforms the original across all measures, indicating that we have uncovered a vastly expanded list of relevant targets. In summary, this work presents a high-quality reanalysis that maximizes the information contained in the Hu et al. compendium. The dataset is available from ArrayExpress (accession: E-MTAB-109) and it will be invaluable to any scientist interested in the yeast transcriptional regulatory system.},

abstract = {Completing the annotation of a genome sequence requires identifying the regulatory sequences that control gene expression. To identify these sequences, we developed an algorithm that searches for short, conserved sequence motifs in the genomes of related species. The method is effective in finding motifs de novo and for refining known regulatory motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We tested one novel motif prediction of the algorithm and found it to be the binding site of Stp2; it is significantly different from the previously predicted Stp2 binding site. We show that Stp2 physically interacts with this sequence motif, and that stp2 mutations affect the expression of genes associated with the motif. We demonstrate that the Stp2 binding site also interacts genetically with Stp1, a regulator of amino acid permease genes and, with Sfp1, a key regulator of cell growth. These results illuminate an important transcriptional circuit that regulates cell growth through external nutrient uptake.},

abstract = {Opsin proteins are essential molecules in mediating the ability of animals to detect and use light for diverse biological functions. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary history of opsins is key to understanding the evolution of light detection and photoreception in animals. As genomic data have appeared and rapidly expanded in quantity, it has become possible to analyse opsins that functionally and histologically are less well characterized, and thus to examine opsin evolution strictly from a genetic perspective. We have incorporated these new data into a large-scale, genome-based analysis of opsin evolution. We use an extensive phylogeny of currently known opsin sequence diversity as a foundation for examining the evolutionary distributions of key functional features within the opsin clade. This new analysis illustrates the lability of opsin protein-expression patterns, site-specific functionality (i.e. counterion position) and G-protein binding interactions. Further, it demonstrates the limitations of current model organisms, and highlights the need for further characterization of many of the opsin sequence groups with unknown function.},

abstract = {N($\alpha$)-Acetyltransferases (NATs) cause the N($\alpha$)-acetylation of the majority of eukaryotic proteins during their translation, although the functions of this modification have been largely unexplored. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), four NATs have been identified: NatA, NatB, NatC, and NatD. In this study, the N($\alpha$)-acetylation status of ribosomal protein was analyzed using NAT mutants combined with two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 60 ribosomal proteins were identified, of which 17 were N($\alpha$)-acetylated by NatA, and two by NatB. The N($\alpha$)-acetylation of two of these, S17 and L23, by NatA was not previously observed. Furthermore, we tested the effect of ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation on protein synthesis using the purified ribosomes from each NAT mutant. It was found that the protein synthesis activities of ribosomes from NatA and NatB mutants were decreased by 27{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively, as compared to that of the normal strain. Furthermore, we have shown that ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation by NatA influences translational fidelity in the presence of paromomycin. These results suggest that ribosomal protein N($\alpha$)-acetylation is necessary to maintain the ribosome's protein synthesis function.},

In most eukaryotes studied, eRF3 consists of an essential, conserved C-terminal domain and a nonessential, nonconserved N-terminal extension. However, in some species, this extension is required for efficient termination. Our data show that the N-terminal extension of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eRF3 also participates in regulation of termination efficiency, but acts as a negative factor, increasing nonsense suppression efficiency in sup35 mutants containing amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain of the protein.},

While the structure and functions of different domains of eRF1 have been sufficiently characterized, the role of eRF3 in translation termination remains unclear. Moreover, the N-terminal domain of eRF3, which is dispensable for termination, is highly divergent. Mammalian eRF3 exists in two isotypes, eRF3a and eRF3b, encoded by genes GSPT1 and GSPT2, respectively. Here we propose that GSPT2 originated through retrotransposition of processed GSPT1 transcript into the genome. Comparison of the 5' non-coding sequences of both genes revealed existence of potential promoter element in 5'UTR of GSPT1 which we suppose to be responsible for GSPT2 transcription.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes involves at least two polypeptide release factors (eRFs), eRF1 and eRF3. In mammals two genes encoding eRF3 structural homologues were identified and named GSPT1 and GSPT2. RESULTS: In the present study, we demonstrate that mouse mGSPT2 but not mGSPT1 could functionally substitute the essential yeast gene SUP35. However, we show that the complementation property of mGSPT1 protein is modified when NH2-tagged by GST. Since mGSPT1 and mGSPT2 differ mainly in their N-terminal regions, we developed a series of N-terminal deleted constructs and tested them for complementation in yeast. We found that at least amino acids spanning 84-120 of mGSPT1 prevent the complementation of sup35 mutation. The fact that chimeras between mGSPT1, mGSPT2 and yeast Sup35 complement the disruption of the SUP35 gene indicates that the N-terminal region of mGSPT1 is not sufficient by itself to prevent complementation. Complementation of the mutant with a double disruption of SUP35 and SUP45 genes is obtained when mGSPT2 and human eRF1 are co-expressed but not by co-expression of mGSPT1 and human eRF1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that the two proteins (mGSPT1 and mGSPT2) are different. We hypothesize that the full length mGSPT1 does not have the properties expected for eRF3.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Termination of translation in eukaryotes is controlled by two interacting polypeptide chain release factors, eRF1 and eRF3. While eRF1 recognizes nonsense codons, eRF3 facilitates polypeptide chain release from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Besides termination, both release factors have essential, but poorly characterized functions outside of translation.

RESULTS: To characterize further the functions of yeast eRF1 and eRF3, a genetic screen for their novel partner proteins was performed. As a result, the genes for gamma (TEF4 and TEF3/CAM1) and alpha (TEF5/EFB1) subunits of the translation elongation factor eEF1B, known to catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on eEF1A, were revealed. These genes act as dosage suppressors of a synthetic growth defect caused by some mutations in the SUP45 and SUP35 genes encoding eRF1 and eRF3, respectively. Extra copies of TEF5 and TEF3 can also suppress the temperature sensitivity of some sup45 and sup35 mutants and reduce nonsense codon readthrough caused by these omnipotent suppressors. Besides, overproduction of eEF1Balpha reduces nonsense codon readthrough in the strain carrying suppressor tRNA. Such effects were not shown for extra copies of TEF2, which encodes eEF1A, thus indicating that they were not due to eEF1A activation.

CONCLUSION: The data obtained demonstrate involvement of the translation elongation factor eEF1B in modulating the functions of translation termination factors and suggest its possible role in GDP for GTP exchange on eRF3.},

abstract = {In yeast, fragmentation of amyloid polymers by the Hsp104 chaperone allows them to propagate as prions. The prion-forming domain of the yeast Sup35 protein is rich in glutamine, asparagine, tyrosine, and glycine residues, which may define its prion properties. Long polyglutamine stretches can also drive amyloid polymerization in yeast, but these polymers are unable to propagate because of poor fragmentation and exist through constant seeding with the Rnq1 prion polymers. We proposed that fragmentation of polyglutamine amyloids may be improved by incorporation of hydrophobic amino acid residues into polyglutamine stretches. To investigate this, we constructed sets of polyglutamine with or without tyrosine stretches fused to the non-prion domains of Sup35. Polymerization of these chimeras started rapidly, and its efficiency increased with stretch size. Polymerization of proteins with polyglutamine stretches shorter than 70 residues required Rnq1 prion seeds. Proteins with longer stretches polymerized independently of Rnq1 and thus could propagate. The presence of tyrosines within polyglutamine stretches dramatically enhanced polymer fragmentation and allowed polymer propagation in the absence of Rnq1 and, in some cases, of Hsp104.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Termination of translation in eukaryotes requires two release factors, eRF1, which recognizes all three nonsense codons and facilitates release of the nascent polypeptide chain, and eRF3 stimulating translation termination in a GTP-depended manner. eRF3 from different organisms possess a highly conservative C region (eRF3C), which is responsible for the function in translation termination, and almost always contain the N-terminal extension, which is inessential and vary both in structure and length. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the N-terminal region of eRF3 is responsible for conversion of this protein into the aggregated and functionally inactive prion form.

RESULTS: Here, we examined functional importance of the N-terminal region of a non-prion form of yeast eRF3. The screen for mutations which are lethal in combination with the SUP35-C allele encoding eRF3C revealed the sup45 mutations which alter the N-terminal domain of eRF1 and increase nonsense codon readthrough. However, further analysis showed that synthetic lethality was not caused by the increased levels of nonsense codon readthrough. Dominant mutations in SUP35-C were obtained and characterized, which remove its synthetic lethality with the identified sup45 mutations, thus indicating that synthetic lethality was not due to a disruption of interaction with proteins that bind to this eRF3 region.

CONCLUSION: These and other data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of eRF3 is involved both in modulation of the efficiency of translation termination and functioning of the eRF1/eRF3 complex outside of translation termination.},

abstract = {The [PSI+] prion determinant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes nonsense suppressor phenotype due to a reduced function of the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3) polymerized into amyloid fibrils. Prion state of the Rnq1 protein, [PIN+], is required for the [PSI+] de novo generation but not propagation. Yeast [psi-] [PIN+] cells overproducing Sup35 can exhibit nonsense suppression without generation of a stable [PSI+]. Here, we show that in such cells, most of Sup35 represents amyloid polymers, although the remaining Sup35 monomer is sufficient for normal translation termination. The presence of these polymers strictly depends on [PIN+], suggesting that their maintenance relies on efficient generation de novo rather than inheritance. Sup35 polymers contain Rnq1, confirming a hypothesis that Rnq1 polymers seed Sup35 polymerization. About 10{\%} of cells overproducing Sup35 form colonies on medium selective for suppression, which suggests that the proportion of Sup35 monomers to polymers varies between cells of transformants, allowing selection of cells deficient for soluble Sup35. A hybrid Sup35 with the N-terminal domain replaced for 66 glutamine residues also polymerizes and can cause nonsense suppression when overproduced. The described polymers of these proteins differ from the [PSI+] polymers by poor heritability and very high frequency of the de novo appearance, thus being more similar to amyloids than to prions.},

abstract = {The SUP45 and SUP35 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode polypeptide chain release factors eRF1 and eRF3, respectively. It has been suggested that the Sup35 protein (Sup35p) is subject to a heritable conformational switch, similar to mammalian prions, thus giving rise to the non-Mendelian [PSI+] nonsense suppressor determinant. In a [PSI+] state, Sup35p forms high-molecular-weight aggregates which may inhibit Sup35p activity, leading to the [PSI+] phenotype. Sup35p is composed of the N-terminal domain (N) required for [PSI+] maintenance, the presumably nonfunctional middle region (M), and the C-terminal domain (C) essential for translation termination. In this study, we observed that the N domain, alone or as a part of larger fragments, can form aggregates in [PSI+] cells. Two sites for Sup45p binding were found within Sup35p: one is formed by the N and M domains, and the other is located within the C domain. Similarly to Sup35p, in [PSI+] cells Sup45p was found in aggregates. The aggregation of Sup45p is caused by its binding to Sup35p and was not observed when the aggregated Sup35p fragments did not contain sites for Sup45p binding. The incorporation of Sup45p into the aggregates should inhibit its activity. The N domain of Sup35p, responsible for its aggregation in [PSI+] cells, may thus act as a repressor of another polypeptide chain release factor, Sup45p. This phenomenon represents a novel mechanism of regulation of gene expression at the posttranslational level.},

abstract = {As time goes by, a postmitotic cell ages following a degeneration process ultimately ending in cell death. This phenomenon is evolutionary conserved and present in unicellular eukaryotes as well, making the yeast chronological aging system an appreciated model. Here, single cells die in a programmed fashion (both by apoptosis and necrosis) for the benefit of the whole population. Besides its meaning for aging and cell death research, age-induced programmed cell death represents the first experimental proof for the so-called group selection theory: Apoptotic genes became selected during evolution because of the benefits they might render to the whole cell culture and not to the individual cell. Many anti‐aging stimuli have been discovered in the yeast chronological aging system and have afterwards been confirmed in higher cells or organisms. New work from the Burhans group (this issue) now demonstrates that glucose signaling has a progeriatric effect on chronologically aged yeast cells: Glucose administration results in a diminished efficacy of cells to enter quiescence, finally causing superoxide‐mediated replication stress and apoptosis.},

abstract = {The motions of mitotic chromosomes are complex and show considerable variety across species. A wealth of evidence supports the idea that microtubule-dependent motor enzymes contribute to this variation and are important both for spindle formation and for the accurate completion of chromosome segregation. Motors that walk towards the spindle pole are, however, dispensable for at least some poleward movements of chromosomes in yeasts, suggesting that depolymerizing spindle microtubules can generate mitotic forces in vivo. Tubulin protofilaments that flare outward in association with microtubule shortening may be the origin of such forces, because they can move objects that are appropriately attached to a microtubule wall. For example, some kinetochore-associated proteins can couple experimental objects, such as microspheres, to shortening microtubules in vitro, moving them over many micrometers. Here, we review recent evidence about such phenomena, highlighting the force-generation mechanisms and different coupling strategies. We also consider bending filaments of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, which form rings girding bacteria at their sites of cytokinesis. Mechanical similarities between these force-generation systems suggest a deep phylogenetic relationship between tubulin depolymerization in eukaryotic mitosis and FtsZ-mediated ring contraction in bacteria.},

Indeed, organisms can be surprisingly robust to environmental and genetic perturbations. Yet, the mechanisms underlying such robustness are controversial. Moreover, how they might affect evolutionary change remains enigmatic. Here, we review the recently appreciated central role of protein homeostasis in buffering and potentiating genetic variation and discuss how these processes mediate the critical influence of the environment on the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Deciphering how robustness emerges from biological organization and the mechanisms by which it is overcome in changing environments will lead to a more complete understanding of both fundamental evolutionary processes and diverse human diseases.},

We describe the means by which these networks inform the cell's decision among the different developmental programs available to them-growth, quiescence, filamentous development, or meiosis/sporulation. We conclude that the highly interconnected signaling networks provide the cell with a highly nuanced view of the environment and that the cell can interpret that information through a sophisticated calculus to achieve optimum responses to any nutritional condition.},

abstract = {Lysine biosynthesis occurs in two ways: the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway and the alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway. The former is present in eubacteria, plants, and algae, whereas the latter was understood to be almost exclusive to fungi. The recent finding of the alpha-aminoadipate reductase (AAR) gene, one of the core genes of the AAA pathway, in the marine protist Corallochytrium limacisporum was, therefore, believed to be a molecular synapomorphy of fungi and C. limacisporum. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a broader search for the AAR gene in eukaryotes, and also analyzed the distribution of the lysA gene, a core gene of the DAP pathway. We show that the evolutionary history of both genes, AAR and lysA, is much more complex than previously believed. Furthermore, the AAR gene is present in several unicellular opisthokonts, thus rebutting the theory that its presence is a molecular synapomorphy between C. limacisporum and fungi. AAR gene seems to be exclusive of Excavata and Unikonts, whereas the lysA gene is present in several unrelated taxa within all major eukaryotic lineages, indicating a role for several lateral gene transfer (LGT) events. Our data imply that the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis and the "choanozoan" Capsaspora owczarzaki acquired their lysA copies from a proteobacterial ancestor. Overall, these observations represent new evidence that the role of LGT in the evolutionary history of eukaryotes may have been more significant than previously thought.},

abstract = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5{\%}) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {The genome of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sequenced over a decade ago and has been annotated to encode approximately 6,000 genes. However, recent high throughput studies using tiling array hybridization and cDNA sequencing have revealed an unexpectedly large number of previously undescribed transcripts. They largely lack protein-coding capacity and are transcribed from both strands of intragenic and intergenic regions in the genome. Accordingly, pervasive transcription leading to a plethora of noncoding RNAs, which was first revealed for mammalian genomes to attract intense attentions, is likely an intrinsic feature of eukaryotic genomes. Although it is not clear what fraction of these transcription events are functional, some were shown to induce transcriptional interference or histone modifications to regulate gene expression. The budding yeast may serve as an excellent model to study pervasive transcription and noncoding RNAs.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction enables genetic exchange in eukaryotic organisms as diverse as fungi, animals, plants, and ciliates. Given its ubiquity, sex is thought to have evolved once, possibly concomitant with or shortly after the origin of eukaryotic organisms themselves. The basic principles of sex are conserved, including ploidy changes, the formation of gametes via meiosis, mate recognition, and cell-cell fusion leading to the production of a zygote. Although the basic tenants are shared, sex determination and sexual reproduction occur in myriad forms throughout nature, including outbreeding systems with more than two mating types or sexes, unisexual selfing, and even examples in which organisms switch mating type. As robust and diverse genetic models, fungi provide insights into the molecular nature of sex, sexual specification, and evolution to advance our understanding of sexual reproduction and its impact throughout the eukaryotic tree of life.},

abstract = {Meiotic crossovers are essential for ensuring correct chromosome segregation as well as for creating new combinations of alleles for natural selection to take place. During meiosis, excess meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated; a subset of these breaks are repaired to form crossovers, whereas the remainder are repaired as non-crossovers. What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale - in addition to current models for the generation of interference - is also included. This Commentary aims to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the factors that promote or prevent meiotic crossing over.},

This plus human and mice diseases caused by translational error generalized the idea that codon ambiguity is detrimental to life. Here we depart from this classical view of deleterious translational error and highlight how codon ambiguity can play important roles in the evolution of novel proteins. We also explain how tRNA mischarging can be relevant for the synthesis of functional proteomes, how codon ambiguity generates phenotypic and genetic diversity and how advantageous phenotypes can be selected, fixed, and inherited. A brief introduction to the molecular nature of translational error is provided; however, detailed information on the mechanistic aspects of mistranslation or comprehensive literature reviews of this topic should be obtained elsewhere.},

Occasionally, 40S subunits remain associated with mRNA and reinitiate at nearby AUGs. We recapitulated reinitiation using a reconstituted mammalian translation system. The presence of eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and Met-tRNAi(Met) was sufficient for recycled 40S subunits to remain on mRNA, scan bidirectionally, and reinitiate at upstream and downstream AUGs if mRNA regions flanking the stop codon were unstructured. Imposition of 3' directionality additionally required eIF4F. Strikingly, posttermination ribosomes were not stably anchored on mRNA and migrated bidirectionally to codons cognate to the P site tRNA. Migration depended on the mode of peptide release (puromycin > eRF1⋅eRF3) and nature of tRNA and was enhanced by eEF2. The mobility of posttermination ribosomes suggests that some reinitiation events could involve 80S ribosomes rather than 40S subunits.},

abstract = {After termination, eukaryotic 80S ribosomes remain associated with mRNA, P-site deacylated tRNA, and release factor eRF1 and must be recycled by dissociating these ligands and separating ribosomes into subunits. Although recycling of eukaryotic posttermination complexes (post-TCs) can be mediated by initiation factors eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A (Pisarev et al., 2007), this energy-free mechanism can function only in a narrow range of low Mg(2+) concentrations. Here, we report that ABCE1, a conserved and essential member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, promotes eukaryotic ribosomal recycling over a wide range of Mg(2+) concentrations. ABCE1 dissociates post-TCs into free 60S subunits and mRNA- and tRNA-bound 40S subunits. It can hydrolyze ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP. NTP hydrolysis by ABCE1 is stimulated by post-TCs and is required for its recycling activity. Importantly, ABCE1 dissociates only post-TCs obtained with eRF1/eRF3 (or eRF1 alone), but not post-TCs obtained with puromycin in eRF1's absence.},

The mechanistic understanding of strategies used by the ribosome to achieve both speed and fidelity during translation results from nearly a half century of biochemical and structural studies. Emerging from these studies is the common theme that the ribosome uses local as well as remote conformational switches to govern induced-fit mechanisms that ensure accuracy in codon recognition during both tRNA selection and translation termination.},

abstract = {A unifying concept that combines the basic features governing self-organization of proteins into complex three-dimensional structures in vitro and in vivo is still lacking. Recent experimental results and theoretical in silico modeling studies provide evidence showing that mRNA might contain an additional layer of information, beyond the amino acid sequence, that fine-tunes in vivo protein folding, which is largely believed to start as a co-translational process. These findings indicate that translation kinetics might direct the co-translational folding pathway and that translational pausing at rare codons might provide a time delay to enable independent and sequential folding of the defined portions of the nascent polypeptide emerging from the ribosome.},

@article{Atkinson2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Members of the eukaryote/archaea specific eRF1 and eRF3 protein families have central roles in translation termination. They are also central to various mRNA surveillance mechanisms, together with the eRF1 paralogue Dom34p and the eRF3 paralogues Hbs1p and Ski7p. We have examined the evolution of eRF1 and eRF3 families using sequence similarity searching, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.

RESULTS: Extensive BLAST searches confirm that Hbs1p and eRF3 are limited to eukaryotes, while Dom34p and eRF1 (a/eRF1) are universal in eukaryotes and archaea. Ski7p appears to be restricted to a subset of Saccharomyces species. Alignments show that Dom34p does not possess the characteristic class-1 RF minidomains GGQ, NIKS and YXCXXXF, in line with recent crystallographic analysis of Dom34p. Phylogenetic trees of the protein families allow us to reconstruct the evolution of mRNA surveillance mechanisms mediated by these proteins in eukaryotes and archaea.

CONCLUSION: We propose that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea possessed Dom34p-mediated no-go decay (NGD). This ancestral Dom34p may or may not have required a trGTPase, mostly like a/eEF1A, for its delivery to the ribosome. At an early stage in eukaryotic evolution, eEF1A was duplicated, giving rise to eRF3, which was recruited for translation termination, interacting with eRF1. eRF3 evolved nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) activity either before or after it was again duplicated, giving rise to Hbs1p, which we propose was recruited to assist eDom34p in eukaryotic NGD. Finally, a third duplication within ascomycete yeast gave rise to Ski7p, which may have become specialised for a subset of existing Hbs1p functions in non-stop decay (NSD). We suggest Ski7p-mediated NSD may be a specialised mechanism for counteracting the effects of increased stop codon read-through caused by prion-domain [PSI+] mediated eRF3 precipitation.},

abstract = {Specific gene silencing has been demonstrated in a number of organisms by the introduction of antisense RNA. Mutagenesis of host-encoded factors has begun to unravel the mechanism of several forms of RNA-mediated gene silencing and has suggested that it may have been conserved through evolution. This has led to the identification of certain host genes, which, when mutated, abrogate this phenomenon. Conversely, the identification of other factors that, when co-expressed or overexpressed, can enhance gene inhibition is equally important for both elucidating the mechanism of this process and enhancing gene silencing in recalcitrant systems. We have taken such a dominant genetic approach to identify several host-encoded factors that dramatically enhance target gene silencing when co-expressed with antisense RNA in fission yeast. The transcription factor thi1 and, surprisingly, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase ded1 were initially shown to enhance gene silencing in this system. Additionally, screening of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA library identified four novel antisense-enhancing sequences (aes factors) all of which are homologous to genes encoding proteins with natural affinities for nucleic acids. These findings demonstrate the utility of this strategy in identifying host-encoded factors that can modulate gene silencing when co-expressed with antisense RNA and possibly other forms of gene-silencing activators.},

Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96{\%} of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7{\%} of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

abstract = {eIF3 binds to 40S ribosomal subunits and stimulates recruitment of Met-tRNAiMet and mRNA to the pre-initiation complex. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an ortholog of human eIF3 subunit p35, HCR1, whose interactions with yeast eIF3 are not well defined. We found that HCR1 has a dual function in translation initiation: it binds to, and stabilizes, the eIF3-eIF5- eIF1-eIF2 multifactor complex and is required for the normal level of 40S ribosomes. The RNA recognition motif (RRM) of eIF3 subunit PRT1 interacted simultaneously with HCR1 and with an internal domain of eIF3 subunit TIF32 that has sequence and functional similarity to HCR1. PRT1, HCR1 and TIF32 were also functionally linked by genetic suppressor analysis. We propose that HCR1 stabilizes or modulates interaction between TIF32 and the PRT1 RRM. Removal of the PRT1 RRM resulted in dissociation of TIF32, NIP1, HCR1 and eIF5 from eIF3 in vivo, and destroyed 40S ribosome binding by the residual PRT1-TIF34-TIF35 subcomplex. Hence, the PRT1 RRM is crucial for the integrity and ribosome-binding activity of eIF3.},

abstract = {Accurate translation termination is essential for cell viability. In eukaryotes, this process is strictly maintained by two proteins, eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1), which recognizes all stop codons and hydrolyzes peptidyl-tRNA, and eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3), which is an elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha) homolog stimulating eRF1 activity. To retrace the evolution of this core system, we cloned and sequenced the eRF3 genes from Trichomonas vaginalis (Parabasalia) and Giardia lamblia (Diplomonada), which are generally thought to be "early-diverging eukaryotes," as well as those from two ciliates (Oxytricha trifallax and Euplotes aediculatus). We also determined the sequence of the eRF1 gene for G. lamblia. Surprisingly, the G. lamblia eRF3 appears to have only one domain, corresponding to EF-1alpha, while other eRF3s (including the T. vaginalis protein) have an additional N-terminal domain, of 66-411 amino acids. Considering this novel eRF3 structure and our extensive phylogenetic analyses, we suggest that (1) the current translation termination system in eukaryotes evolved from the archaea-like version, (2) eRF3 was introduced into the system prior to the divergence of extant eukaryotes, including G. lamblia, and (3) G. lamblia might be the first eukaryotic branch among the organisms considered.},

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are charged with an amino acid and brought to the ribosome, where they are paired with the corresponding trinucleotide codon in mRNA. The amino acid is attached to the nascent polypeptide and the ribosome moves on to the next codon. The cycle is then repeated to produce a full-length protein. Proofreading and editing processes are used throughout protein synthesis to ensure the faithful translation of genetic information. The maturation of tRNAs and mRNAs is monitored, as is the identity of amino acids attached to tRNAs. Accuracy is further enhanced during the selection of aminoacyl-tRNAs on the ribosome and their base pairing with mRNA.

abstract = {The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway functions to degrade aberrant mRNAs that contain premature translation termination codons. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3 proteins have been identified as trans-acting factors involved in this pathway. Recent results have demonstrated that the Upf proteins may also be involved in maintaining the fidelity of several aspects of the translation process. Certain mutations in the UPF1 gene have been shown to affect the efficiency of translation termination at nonsense codons and/or the process of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting used by viruses to control their gene expression. Alteration of programmed frameshift efficiencies can affect virus assembly leading to reduced viral titers or elimination of the virus. Here we present evidence that the Upf3 protein also functions to regulate programmed -1 frameshift efficiency. A upf3-Delta strain demonstrates increased sensitivity to the antibiotic paromomycin and increased programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiency resulting in loss of the M1 virus. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the Upf proteins are part of a surveillance complex that functions to monitor translational fidelity and mRNA turnover.},

abstract = {Studies of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have greatly advanced our understanding of the posttranscriptional steps of eukaryotic gene expression. Given the wide range of experimental tools applicable to S. cerevisiae and the recent determination of its complete genomic sequence, many of the key challenges of the posttranscriptional control field can be tackled particularly effectively by using this organism. This article reviews the current knowledge of the cellular components and mechanisms related to translation and mRNA decay, with the emphasis on the molecular basis for rate control and gene regulation. Recent progress in characterizing translation factors and their protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions has been rapid. Against the background of a growing body of structural information, the review discusses the thermodynamic and kinetic principles that govern the translation process. As in prokaryotic systems, translational initiation is a key point of control. Modulation of the activities of translational initiation factors imposes global regulation in the cell, while structural features of particular 5' untranslated regions, such as upstream open reading frames and effector binding sites, allow for gene-specific regulation. Recent data have revealed many new details of the molecular mechanisms involved while providing insight into the functional overlaps and molecular networking that are apparently a key feature of evolving cellular systems. An overall picture of the mechanisms governing mRNA decay has only very recently begun to develop. The latest work has revealed new information about the mRNA decay pathways, the components of the mRNA degradation machinery, and the way in which these might relate to the translation apparatus. Overall, major challenges still to be addressed include the task of relating principles of posttranscriptional control to cellular compartmentalization and polysome structure and the role of molecular channelling in these highly complex expression systems.},

abstract = {An adenine-rich cis element at the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of Pabp1 mRNA is able to inhibit translation of its own mRNA. Similar inhibition of translation of a reporter beta-galactosidase mRNA is observed when the adenine-rich auto regulatory sequence (ARS) is placed within the 5'-UTR of this mRNA. For this translational control the distance of the ARS from the 5' cap is not important. However, it determines the number of 40 S ribosomal subunits bound to the translationally arrested mRNA. Inhibition of mRNA translation by this regulatory sequence occurs at the step of joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the pre-initiation complex. Translational arrest of the ARS containing mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of exogenous Pabp1 protects the 5'-flanking region of the ARS from nuclease digestion. This protection depends on the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. The size and the sequence of the nucleotide-protected fragment depends on the location of the ARS within the 5'-UTR. When the ARS is located at a distance of about 78 nucleotides from the 5' cap, a 40-nucleotide long region adjacent to the ARS is protected. On the other hand, when the ARS is moved further away from the 5' cap to a distance of approximately 267 nucleotides, a 100-nucleotide-long region adjacent to the ARS is protected from nuclease digestion. Nuclease protection is attributed to the presence of one or more stalled 40 S ribosomal subunits near the Pabp1-bound ARS.},

abstract = {The poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs regulates translation and RNA stability through an association with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). The role of PABP in selective polyadenylation/deadenylation and translational recruitment/repression of maternal mRNAs that occurs in early development is not fully understood. Here, we report studies including UV-crosslinking and immunoblotting assays to characterise PABP in the early developmental stages of the clam Spisula solidissima. A single, 70 kDa PABP, whose sequence is highly homologous to vertebrate, yeast and plant PABPs, is detected in oocytes. The levels of clam PABP are constant in early embryogenesis, although its ability to crosslink labelled poly(A) is 'masked' shortly after fertilisation and remains so until the larval stage. Full RNA-binding potential of PABP in embryo lysates was achieved by brief denaturation with guanidinium hydrochloride followed by dilution for binding and crosslinking or by controlled treatment of lysates with Ca(2+)-dependent micrococcal nuclease. Masking of PABP, which accompanies cytoplasmic polyadenylation in maturing oocytes and in in vitro activated oocyte lysates, is very likely due to an association with mRNAs that bear new PABP target binding sites and thus prevent protein binding to the labelled A-rich probe. Functional implications of these findings as well as the potential application of this unmasking method to other RNA-binding proteins is discussed.},

@article{Betney2012a,
abstract = {The essential eukaryote release factor eRF1, encoded by the yeast SUP45 gene, recognizes stop codons during ribosomal translation. SUP45 nonsense alleles are, however, viable due to the establishment of feedback-regulated readthrough of the premature termination codon; reductions in full-length eRF1 promote tRNA-mediated stop codon readthrough, which, in turn, drives partial production of full-length eRF1. A deterministic mathematical model of this eRF1 feedback loop was developed using a staged increase in model complexity. Model predictions matched the experimental observation that strains carrying the mutant SUQ5 tRNA (a weak UAA suppressor) in combination with any of the tested sup45(UAA) nonsense alleles exhibit threefold more stop codon readthrough than that of an SUQ5 yeast strain. The model also successfully predicted that eRF1 feedback control in an SUQ5 sup45(UAA) mutant would resist, but not completely prevent, imposed changes in eRF1 expression. In these experiments, the introduction of a plasmid-borne SUQ5 copy into a sup45(UAA) SUQ5 mutant directed additional readthrough and full-length eRF1 expression, despite feedback. Secondly, induction of additional sup45(UAA) mRNA expression in a sup45(UAA) SUQ5 strain also directed increased full-length eRF1 expression. The autogenous sup45 control mechanism therefore acts not to precisely control eRF1 expression, but rather as a damping mechanism that only partially resists changes in release factor expression level. The validated model predicts that the degree of feedback damping (i.e., control precision) is proportional to eRF1 affinity for the premature stop codon. The validated model represents an important tool to analyze this and other translational negative feedback loops.},

abstract = {In termination of protein synthesis, the bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 bind to the ribosome through specific recognition of messenger RNA stop codons and trigger hydrolysis of the bond between the nascent polypeptide and the transfer RNA at the peptidyl-tRNA site, thereby releasing the newly synthesized protein. The release factors are highly specific for a U in the first stop-codon position and recognize different combinations of purines in the second and third positions, with RF1 reading UAA and UAG and RF2 reading UAA and UGA. With recently determined crystal structures of termination complexes, it has become possible to decipher the energetics of stop-codon reading by computational analysis and to clarify the origin of the high release-factor binding accuracy. Here we report molecular dynamics free-energy calculations on different cognate and non-cognate termination complexes. The simulations quantitatively explain the basic principles of decoding in all three codon positions and reveal the key elements responsible for specificity of the release factors. The overall reading mechanism involves hitherto unidentified interactions and recognition switches that cannot be described in terms of a tripeptide anticodon model. Further simulations of complexes with tRNA(Trp), the tRNA recognizing the triplet codon for Trp, explain the observation of a 'leaky' stop codon and highlight the fundamentally different third position reading by RF2, which leads to a high stop-codon specificity with strong discrimination against the Trp codon. The simulations clearly illustrate the versatility of codon reading by protein, which goes far beyond tRNA mimicry.},

abstract = {Translation is the final stage of gene expression where messenger RNA is used as a template for protein polymerization from appropriate amino acids. Release of the completed protein requires a release factor protein acting at the termination/stop codon to liberate it. In this paper we focus on a complex feedback control mechanism involved in the translation and synthesis of release factor proteins, which has been observed in different systems. These release factor proteins are involved in the termination stage of their own translation. Further, mutations in the release factor gene can result in a premature stop codon. In this case translation can result either in early termination and the production of a truncated protein or readthrough of the premature stop codon and production of the complete release factor protein. Thus during translation of the release factor mRNA containing a premature stop codon, the full length protein negatively regulates its production by its action on a premature stop codon, while positively regulating its production by its action on the regular stop codon. This paper develops a mathematical modelling framework to investigate this complex feedback control system involved in translation. A series of models is established to carefully investigate the role of individual mechanisms and how they work together. The steady state and dynamic behaviour of the resulting models are examined both analytically and numerically.},

abstract = {Translation termination in eukaryotes is governed by the concerted action of eRF1 and eRF3 factors. eRF1 recognizes the stop codon in the A site of the ribosome and promotes nascent peptide chain release, and the GTPase eRF3 facilitates this peptide release via its interaction with eRF1. In addition to its role in termination, eRF3 is involved in normal and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay through its association with cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) via PAM2-1 and PAM2-2 motifs in the N-terminal domain of eRF3. We have studied complex formation between full-length eRF3 and its ligands (GDP, GTP, eRF1 and PABP) using isothermal titration calorimetry, demonstrating formation of the eRF1:eRF3:PABP:GTP complex. Analysis of the temperature dependence of eRF3 interactions with G nucleotides reveals major structural rearrangements accompanying formation of the eRF1:eRF3:GTP complex. This is in contrast to eRF1:eRF3:GDP complex formation, where no such rearrangements were detected. Thus, our results agree with the established active role of GTP in promoting translation termination. Through point mutagenesis of PAM2-1 and PAM2-2 motifs in eRF3, we demonstrate that PAM2-2, but not PAM2-1 is indispensible for eRF3:PABP complex formation.},

abstract = {Organisms that use the standard genetic code recognize UAA, UAG, and UGA as stop codons, whereas variant code species frequently alter this pattern of stop codon recognition. We previously demonstrated that a hybrid eRF1 carrying the Euplotes octocarinatus domain 1 fused to Saccharomyces cerevisiae domains 2 and 3 (Eo/Sc eRF1) recognized UAA and UAG, but not UGA, as stop codons. In the current study, we identified mutations in Eo/Sc eRF1 that restore UGA recognition and define distinct roles for the TASNIKS and YxCxxxF motifs in eRF1 function. Mutations in or near the YxCxxxF motif support the cavity model for stop codon recognition by eRF1. Mutations in the TASNIKS motif eliminated the eRF3 requirement for peptide release at UAA and UAG codons, but not UGA codons. These results suggest that the TASNIKS motif and eRF3 function together to trigger eRF1 conformational changes that couple stop codon recognition and peptide release during eukaryotic translation termination.},

abstract = {During translation termination, release factor (RF) protein catalyzes a hydrolytic reaction in the large subunit peptidyl transferase center to release the finished polypeptide chain. While the mechanism of catalysis of peptide release remains obscure, important contributing factors have been identified, including conserved active-site nucleotides and a GGQ tripeptide motif in the RF. Here we describe pre-steady-state kinetic and nucleophile competition experiments to examine RF contributions to the rate and specificity of peptide release. We find that while unacylated tRNA stimulates release in a nondiscriminating manner, RF1 is very specific for water. Further analysis reveals that amino acid Q235 of the RF1 GGQ motif is critical for the observed specificity. These data lead to a model where RFs make two distinct contributions to catalysis--a relatively nonspecific activation of the catalytic center and specific selection of water as a nucleophile facilitated by Q235.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) is a GTPase associated with eRF1 in a complex that mediates translation termination in eukaryotes. Studies have related eRF3 with cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton organization, and tumorigenesis. In mammals, two genes encode two distinct forms of eRF3, eRF3a and eRF3b, which differ in their N-terminal domains. eRF3a is the major factor acting in translation termination, and its expression level controls termination complex formation. Here, we investigate the role of eRF3a in cell cycle progression using short interfering RNAs and flow cytometry. We show that eRF3a depletion induces a G1 arrest and that eRF3a GTP-binding activity, but not the eRF3a N-terminal domain, is required to restore G1-to-S-phase progression. We also show that eRF3a depletion decreases the global translation rate and reduces the polysome charge of mRNA. Finally, we show that two substrates of the mammalian TOR (mTOR) kinase, 4E-BP1 and protein kinase S6K1, are hypophosphorylated in eRF3a-depleted cells. These results strongly suggest that the G1 arrest and the decrease in translation induced by eRF3a depletion are due to the inhibition of mTOR activity and hence that eRF3a belongs to the regulatory pathway of mTOR activity.},

Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we have identified a member of the DEAD-box protein (DBP) family, the DEAD-box RNA helicase and mRNA export factor Dbp5, as a player in translation termination. Dbp5 interacts genetically with both release factors and the polyadenlyate-binding protein Pab1. A physical interaction was specifically detected with eRF1. Moreover, we show that the helicase activity of Dbp5 is required for efficient stop-codon recognition, and intact Dbp5 is essential for recruitment of eRF3 into termination complexes. Therefore, Dbp5 controls the eRF3-eRF1 interaction and thus eRF3-mediated downstream events.},

Although it has been known for a long time that these processes are functionally linked, often by the use of common protein factors, it has only recently become apparent that many of these processes are also physically connected. Indeed, proteins that are involved in mRNA degradation, translational repression, mRNA surveillance and RNA-mediated gene silencing, together with their mRNA targets, colocalize within discrete cytoplasmic domains known as P bodies. The available evidence indicates that P bodies are sites where mRNAs that are not being translated accumulate, the information carried by associated proteins and regulatory RNAs is integrated, and their fate - either translation, silencing or decay - is decided.},

abstract = {In eubacteria, termination of translation is signaled by any one of the stop codons UAA, UAG, and UGA moving into the ribosomal A site. Two release factors, RF1 and RF2, recognize and bind to the stop codons with different affinities and trigger the hydrolysis of the ester bond that links the polypeptide with the P-site tRNA. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results obtained in this study show that ribosome-bound RF1 is in an open conformation, unlike the closed conformation observed in the crystal structure of the free factor, allowing its simultaneous access to both the decoding center and the peptidyl-transferase center. These results are similar to those obtained for RF2, but there is an important difference in how the factors bind to protein L11, which forms part of the GTPase-associated center of the large ribosomal subunit. The difference in the binding position, C-terminal domain for RF2 versus N-terminal domain for RF1, explains a body of L11 mutation studies that revealed differential effects on the activity of the two factors. Very recent data obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering now reveal that the solution structure of RF1 is open, as here seen on the ribosome by cryo-EM, and not closed, as seen in the crystal.},

abstract = {The translation release factors (RFs) RF1 and RF2 of Escherichia coli are methylated at the N5-glutamine of the GGQ motif by PrmC methyltransferase. This motif is conserved in organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFs, mitochondrial Mrf1p and cytoplasmic Sup45p (eRF1), have sequence similarities to the bacterial RFs, including the potential site of glutamine methylation in the GGQ motif. A computational analysis revealed two yeast proteins, Mtq1p and Mtq2p, that have strong sequence similarity to PrmC. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Mtq1p and Mtq2p methylate Mrf1p and Sup45p, respectively, in vivo. A tryptic peptide of Mrf1p, GGQHVNTTDSAVR, containing the GGQ motif was found to be approximately 50{\%} methylated at the glutamine residue in the normal strain but completely unmodified in the peptide from mtq1-Delta. Moreover, Mtq1p methyltransferase activity was observed in an in vitro assay. In similar experiments, it was determined that Mtq2p methylates Sup45p. The Sup45p methylation by Mtq2p was recently confirmed independently (Heurgue-Hamard, V., Champ, S., Mora, L., Merkulova-Rainon, T., Kisselev, L. L., and Buckingham, R. H. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2439-2445). Analysis of the deletion mutants showed that although mtq1-Delta had only moderate growth defects on nonfermentable carbon sources, the mtq2-Delta had multiple phenotypes, including cold sensitivity and sensitivity to translation fidelity antibiotics paromomycin and geneticin, to high salt and calcium concentrations, to polymyxin B, and to caffeine. Also, the mitochondrial mit(-) mutation, cox2-V25, containing a premature stop mutation, was suppressed by mtq1-Delta. Most interestingly, the mtq2-Delta was significantly more resistant to the anti-microtubule drugs thiabendazole and benomyl, suggesting that Mtq2p may also methylate certain microtubule-related proteins.},

Here, isothermal titration calorimetry is used for the quantitative thermodynamic characterization of eRF3 interactions with guanine nucleotides, eRF1 and Mg2+. We show that (i) eRF3 binds GDP (K(d) = 1.9 microM) and this interaction depends only minimally on the Mg(2+) concentration; (ii) GTP binds to eRF3 (K(d) = 0.5 microM) only in the presence of eRF1 and this interaction depends on the Mg2+ concentration; (iii) GTP displaces GDP from the eRF1*eRF3*GDP complex, and vice versa; (iv) eRF3 in the GDP-bound form improves its ability to bind eRF1; (v) the eRF1*eRF3 complex binds GDP as efficiently as free eRF3; (vi) the eRF1*eRF3 complex is efficiently formed in the absence of GDP/GTP but requires the presence of the C-terminus of eRF1 for complex formation. Our results show that eRF1 mediates GDP/GTP displacement on eRF3. We suggest that after formation of eRF1*eRF3*GTP*Mg2+, this quaternary complex binds to the ribosomal pretermination complex containing P-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and the A-site-bound stop codon. The guanine nucleotide binding properties of eRF3 and of the eRF3*eRF1 complex profoundly differ from those of prokaryotic RF3.},

Here we show that eRF1 methylation, in addition to these previously characterized components, requires a 15-kDa zinc-binding protein, Ynr046w. Co-expression in Escherichia coli of Ynr046w and Ydr140w allows the latter to be recovered in soluble form rather than as inclusion bodies, and the two proteins co-purify on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography when Ydr140w alone carries a His tag. The crystal structure of Ynr046w has been determined to 1.7 A resolution. It comprises a zinc-binding domain built from both the N- and C-terminal sequences and an inserted domain, absent from bacterial and archaeal orthologs of the protein, composed of three alpha-helices. The active methyltransferase is the heterodimer Ydr140w.Ynr046w, but when alone, both in solution and in crystals, Ynr046w appears to be a homodimer. The Ynr046w eRF1 methyltransferase subunit is shared by the tRNA methyltransferase Trm11p and probably by two other enzymes containing a Rossman fold.},

abstract = {Six diverse prokaryotic and five eukaryotic genomes were compared to deduce whether the protein synthesis termination signal has common determinants within and across both kingdoms. Four of the six prokaryotic and all of the eukaryotic genomes investigated demonstrated a similar pattern of nucleotide bias both 5' and 3' of the stop codon. A preferred core signal of 4 nt was evident, encompassing the stop codon and the following nucleotide. Codons decoded by hyper-modified tRNAs were over-represented in the region 5' to the stop codon in genes from both kingdoms. The origin of the 3' bias was more variable particularly among the prokaryotic organisms. In both kingdoms, genes with the highest expression index exhibited a strong bias but genes with the lowest expression showed none. Absence of bias in parasitic prokaryotes may reflect an absence of pressure to evolve more efficient translation. Experiments were undertaken to determine if a correlation existed between bias in signal abundance and termination efficiency. In Escherichia coli signal abundance correlated with termination efficiency for UAA and UGA stop codons, but not in mammalian cells. Termination signals that were highly inefficient could be made more efficient by increasing the concentration of the cognate decoding release factor.},

abstract = {Mitochondria have a single release factor that recognizes all stop codons in mRNAs. The yeast mitochondrial release factor, mRF1, is a protein of 43 kDa that emerges from its precursor by cleavage of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. mRF1 is localized exclusively in mitochondria, even when it is overproduced. A several-fold increase in mRF1 levels slightly inhibits the growth of wild-type cells on media containing a non-fermentable carbon source. A direct antisuppressor effect of overproduced mRF1 is observed, since the MRF1 gene on a multicopy plasmid causes Gly(-) phenotypes of the leaky mit(-) point mutations in mtDNA. We also examine steady-state mRF1 levels in a respiratory-deficient mrf1-780 mutant with inhibited mitochondrial translation. We show that both the mRF1 protein and the MRF1 transcript are elevated in mrf1-780 cells. A similar increase in mRF1 expression is observed in the rho(0) strain with no mitochondrial translation. This is indicative of retrograde signalling in the regulation of MRF1 expression. According to our hypothesis, inhibition of translation in the mrf1-780 strain is due to mitoribosome stalling at the stop codon and the observed elevated level of release factor is a secondary effect of respiratory deficiency.},

We identify and characterize the human translation termination factor eRF3/GSPT1 as an interacting partner of RNase L. We show that interaction of eRF3 with RNase L leads to both increased translation readthrough efficiency at premature termination codons and increased +1 frameshift efficiency at the antizyme +1 frameshift site. On the basis of our results, we present a model describing how RNase L is involved in regulating gene expression by modulating the translation termination process.},

@article{Kim2005,
abstract = {The genetic code of nuclear genes in some ciliates was found to differ from that of other organisms in the assignment of UGA, UAG, and UAA codons, which are normally assigned as stop codons. In some ciliate species, the universal stop codons UAA and UAG instead encode glutamine. In some other ciliates, the universal stop codon UGA appears to be translated as cysteine or tryptophan. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) is a key protein in stop codon recognition, thus, the protein is believed to play an important role in the stop codon reassignment in ciliates. We have cloned, sequenced, and analyzed the cDNA of eRF1 from four ciliate species of three different classes: Karyorelictea (Loxodes striatus), Heterotrichea (Blepharisma musculus), and Litostomatea (Didinium nasutum, Dileptus margaritifer). Phylogenetic analysis of these eRF1s supports the hypothesis that the genetic code in ciliates has deviated independently several times from the universal genetic code, and that different ciliate eRF1s may have undergone different processes to change the codon specificity. Using computational methods, we have also suggested areas on the surface of eRF1s that are important for stop codon recognition in ciliate eRF1s.},

abstract = {Polypeptide release factors from eubacteria and eukaryotes, although similar in function, belong to different protein families. They share one sequence motif, a GGQ tripeptide that is vital to release factor (RF) activity in both kingdoms. In bacteria, the Gln residue of the motif in RF1 and RF2 is modified to N(5)-methyl-Gln by the S-adenosyl l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase PrmC and the absence of Gln methylation decreases the release activity of Escherichia coli RF2 in vitro severalfold. We show here that the same modification is made to the GGQ motif of Saccharomyces cerevisiae release factor eRF1, the first time that N(5)-methyl-Gln has been found outside the bacterial kingdom. The product of the YDR140w gene is required for the methylation of eRF1 in vivo and for optimal yeast cell growth. YDR140w protein has significant homology to PrmC but lacks the N-terminal domain thought to be involved in the recognition of the bacterial release factors. Overproduced in S. cerevisiae, YDR140w can methylate eRF1 from yeast or man in vitro using S-adenosyl l-methionine as methyl donor provided that eRF3 and GTP are also present, suggesting that the natural substrate of the methyltransferase YDR140w is the ternary complex eRF1.eRF3.GTP.},

@article{Ma2004a,
abstract = {Class I release factors 1 and 2 (RF1 and RF2) terminate protein synthesis by recognizing stop codons on the mRNA via their conserved amino acid motifs (NIKS in eRF1 and SPF in RF2) and by the conserved tripeptide (GGQ) interactions with the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center. Crystal structures of eRF1 and RF2 do not fit their ribosomal binding pocket (approximately 73 angstroms). Cryoelectron microscopy indicates large conformational changes in the ribosome-bound RF2. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of the eRF1 and RF2 using molecular dynamics simulation, structural alignment, and electrostatic analysis of domain interactions. We show that relaxed eRF1 has a shape remarkably similar to the ribosome-bound RF2 observed by cryoelectron microscopy. The similarity between the two release factors is as good as between elongation factor G and elongation factor Tu-guanosine-5'(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate-tRNA. Further, the conformational transitions and dynamics of eRF1 and RF2 between the free and ribosome-bound states are most likely controlled by protonation of conserved histidines. For eRF1, the distance between the NIKS and GGQ motifs shrinks from 97.5 angstroms in the crystal to 70-80 angstroms. For RF2, the separation between SPF and GGQ elongates from 32 angstroms in the crystal to 50 angstroms. Coulombic interaction strongly favors the open conformation of eRF1; however, solvation and histidine protonation modulate the domain interactions, making the closed conformation of eRF1 more accessible. Thus, RF1 and RF2 function like molecular machines, most likely fueled by histidine protonation. The unified conformational control and the shapes of eRF1 and RF2 support the proposition that the termination of protein synthesis involves similar mechanisms across species.},

@article{Janzen2004b,
abstract = {Two competing events, termination and readthrough (or nonsense suppression), can occur when a stop codon reaches the A-site of a translating ribosome. Translation termination results in hydrolysis of the final peptidyl-tRNA bond and release of the completed nascent polypeptide. Alternatively, readthrough, in which the stop codon is erroneously decoded by a suppressor or near cognate transfer RNA (tRNA), results in translation past the stop codon and production of a protein with a C-terminal extension. The relative frequency of termination versus readthrough is determined by parameters such as the stop codon nucleotide context, the activities of termination factors and the abundance of suppressor tRNAs. Using a sensitive and versatile readthrough assay in conjunction with RNA interference technology, we assessed the effects of depleting eukaryotic releases factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) on the termination reaction in human cell lines. Consistent with the established role of eRF1 in triggering peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we found that depletion of eRF1 enhances readthrough at all three stop codons in 293 cells and HeLa cells. The role of eRF3 in eukarytotic translation termination is less well understood as its overexpression has been shown to have anti-suppressor effects in yeast but not mammalian systems. We found that depletion of eRF3 has little or no effect on readthrough in 293 cells but does increase readthrough at all three stop codons in HeLa cells. These results support a direct role for eRF3 in translation termination in higher eukaryotes and also highlight the potential for differences in the abundance or activity of termination factors to modulate the balance of termination to readthrough reactions in a cell-type-specific manner.},

abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons. In mammalian cells, a termination codon is ordinarily recognized as "premature" if it is located greater than 50-54 nucleotides 5' to the final exon-exon junction. We have described a set of naturally occurring human beta-globin gene mutations that apparently contradict this rule. The corresponding beta-thalassemia genes contain nonsense mutations within exon 1, and yet their encoded mRNAs accumulate to levels approaching wild-type beta-globin (beta(WT)) mRNA. In the present report we demonstrate that the stabilities of these mRNAs with nonsense mutations in exon 1 are intermediate between beta(WT) mRNA and beta-globin mRNA carrying a prototype NMD-sensitive mutation in exon 2 (codon 39 nonsense; beta 39). Functional analyses of these mRNAs with 5'-proximal nonsense mutations demonstrate that their relative resistance to NMD does not reflect abnormal RNA splicing or translation re-initiation and is independent of promoter identity and erythroid specificity. Instead, the proximity of the nonsense codon to the translation initiation AUG constitutes a major determinant of NMD. Positioning a termination mutation at the 5' terminus of the coding region blunts mRNA destabilization, and this effect is dominant to the "50-54 nt boundary rule." These observations impact on current models of NMD.},

abstract = {The function of the decoding release factor (RF) in translation termination is to couple cognate recognition of the stop codon in the mRNA with hydrolysis of the completed polypeptide from its covalently linked tRNA. For this to occur, the RF must interact with specific A-site components of the active centers within both the small and large ribosomal subunits. In this work, we have used directed hydroxyl radical footprinting to map the ribosomal binding site of the Escherichia coli class I release factor RF2, during translation termination. In the presence of the cognate UGA stop codon, residues flanking the universally conserved (250)GGQ(252) motif of RF2 were each shown to footprint to the large ribosomal subunit, specifically to conserved elements of the peptidyltransferase and GTPase-associated centers. In contrast, residues that flank the putative "peptide anticodon" of RF2, (205)SPF(207), were shown to make a footprint in the small ribosomal subunit at positions within well characterized 16 S rRNA motifs in the vicinity of the decoding center. Within the recently solved crystal structure of E. coli RF2, the GGQ and SPF motifs are separated by 23 A only, a distance that is incompatible with the observed cleavage sites that are up to 100 A apart. Our data suggest that RF2 may undergo gross conformational changes upon ribosome binding, the implications of which are discussed in terms of the mechanism of RF-mediated termination.},

abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for the proliferation and subsequent stabilization of introns within the eukaryotic lineage have remained elusive. In the early stages of eukaryotic evolution, most introns may have been mildly deleterious at the time of insertion, but enough of them eventually acquired integral roles in transcript processing that few eukaryotic species can any longer survive without them. We suggest that the proliferation of spliceosomal introns was facilitated by the evolution of nonsense-mediated decay, an ancient and (in many cases) intron-dependent mechanism for eliminating aberrant mRNA molecules resulting from errors in transcription and splicing and from mutations at the DNA level. The spatial distribution of introns, as revealed by whole-genome analysis, is consistent with expectations for a model in which maximum protective coverage of a gene stochastically evolves over time.},

Recent results show that mRNAs without translation termination codons are unstable in eukaryotic cells.

The degradation of nonstop transcripts requires the exosome-associated protein Ski7p. Ski7p is closely related to the translation elongation factor EF1A and the translation termination factor eRF3. This suggests that the recognition of nonstop mRNAs involves the binding of Ski7p to an empty aminoacyl-(RNA-binding) site (A site) on the ribosome, thereby bringing the exosome to a mRNA with a ribosome stalled near the 3' end.

Two coupled conveying processes, the passing of compact tRNA globules and the drawing of linear mRNA chain through intraribosomal channel, are considered driven by discrete acts of translocation during translation. Instead of mechanical transmission mechanisms and power-stroke 'motors', thermal motion and chemically induced changes in affinities of ribosomal binding sites for their ligands (tRNAs, mRNA, elongation factors) are proposed to underlie all the directional movements within the ribosomal complex. The GTP-dependent catalysis of conformational transitions by elongation factors during translation is also discussed.},

abstract = {Rrp43p is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae exosome subunit involved in pre-rRNA processing which is found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. So far, no function has been assigned to the cytoplasmic fraction of Rrp43p. We have addressed Rrp43p function by analyzing mRNA stability in three rrp43 temperature-sensitive (ts) strains, which carry different ts alleles (rrp43-1, rrp43-2 and rrp43-3), and by analyzing Rrp43p interactions with the remaining exosome subunits. In the ts strains, endogenous mRNAs (ACT1 and PAB1), as well as a heterologous reporter mRNA (CATpG) showed longer half-lives, relative to a control strain carrying wild-type RRP43. The mutants also accumulated a degradation intermediate of the reporter mRNA that is typical of defective mRNA decay. These results allow us to propose that Rrp43p is required for mRNA degradation. Rrp43p interacts with the exosome complex via Rrp46p, as determined by two-hybrid analyses. Interestingly, the rrp43 ts mutant proteins do not interact with Rrp46p, indicating that the ts phenotype may be caused by disruption of the Rrp43p- Rrp46p interaction. The ts strains also showed a pre-rRNA processing defect, which is consistent with previous studies on Rrp43p function.},

@article{Moreira2002a,
abstract = {Translation is carried out by the ribosome and several associated protein factors through three consecutive steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Termination remains the least understood of them, partly because of the nonuniversality of the factors involved. To get some insights on the evolution of eukaryotic translation termination, we have compared the phylogeny of the release factors eRF1 and eRF3 to that of the elongation factors EF-1alpha and EF-2, with special focus on ciliates. Our results show that these four translation proteins have experienced different modes of evolution. This is especially evident for the EF-1alpha, EF-2, and eRF1 ciliate sequences. Ciliates appear as monophyletic in the EF-2 phylogenetic tree but not in the EF-1alpha and eRF1 phylogenetic trees. This seems to be mainly because of phylogeny reconstruction artifacts (the long-branch attraction) produced by the acceleration of evolutionary rate of ciliate EF-1alpha and eRF1 sequences. Interaction with the highly divergent actin found in ciliates, or on the contrary, loss of interaction, could explain the acceleration of the evolutionary rate of the EF-1alpha sequences. In the case of ciliate eRF1 sequences, their unusually high evolutionary rate may be related to the deviations in the genetic code usage found in diverse ciliates. These deviations involve a relaxation (or even abolition) of the recognition of one or two stop codons by eRF1. To achieve this, structural changes in eRF1 are needed, and this may affect its evolutionary rate. Eukaryotic translation seems to have followed a mosaic evolution, with its different elements governed by different selective pressures. However, a correlation analysis shows that, beneath the disagreement shown by the different translation proteins, their concerted evolution can still be made apparent when they are compared with other proteins that are not involved in translation.},

Accurate phasing of these mRNAs onto the ribosome was achieved by the addition of tRNA(Asp). Under these conditions, eRF1 was shown to crosslink exclusively to mRNAs containing a stop or s(4)UGG codon. A procedure that yielded (32)P-labeled eRF1 deprived of the mRNA chain was developed; analysis of the labeled peptides generated after specific cleavage of both wild-type and mutant eRF1s maps the crosslink in the tripeptide KSR (positions 63-65 of human eRF1) and points to K63 located in the conserved NIKS loop as the main crosslinking site. These data directly show the interaction of the N-terminal (N) domain of eRF1 with stop codons within the 40S ribosomal subunit and provide strong support for the positioning of the eRF1 middle (M) domain on the 60S subunit. Thus, the N and M domains mimic the tRNA anticodon and acceptor arms, respectively.},

abstract = {To study positioning of the mRNA stop signal with respect to polypeptide chain release factors (RFs) and ribosomal components within human 80S ribosomes, photoreactive mRNA analogs were applied. Derivatives of the UUCUAAA heptaribonucleotide containing the UUC codon for Phe and the stop signal UAAA, which bore a perfluoroaryl azido group at either the fourth nucleotide or the 3'-terminal phosphate, were synthesized. The UUC codon was directed to the ribosomal P site by the cognate tRNA(Phe), targeting the UAA stop codon to the A site. Mild UV irradiation of the ternary complexes consisting of the 80S ribosome, the mRNA analog and tRNA resulted in tRNA-dependent crosslinking of the mRNA analogs to the 40S ribosomal proteins and the 18S rRNA. mRNA analogs with the photoreactive group at the fourth uridine (the first base of the stop codon) crosslinked mainly to protein S15 (and much less to S2). For the 3'-modified mRNA analog, the major crosslinking target was protein S2, while protein S15 was much less crosslinked. Crosslinking of eukaryotic (e) RF1 was entirely dependent on the presence of a stop signal in the mRNA analog. eRF3 in the presence of eRF1 did not crosslink, but decreased the yield of eRF1 crosslinking. We conclude that (i) proteins S15 and S2 of the 40S ribosomal subunit are located near the A site-bound codon; (ii) eRF1 can induce spatial rearrangement of the 80S ribosome leading to movement of protein L4 of the 60S ribosomal subunit closer to the codon located at the A site; (iii) within the 80S ribosome, eRF3 in the presence of eRF1 does not contact the stop codon at the A site and is probably located mostly (if not entirely) on the 60S subunit.},

abstract = {Functional and structural similarities between tRNA and eukaryotic class 1 release factors (eRF1) described previously, provide evidence for the molecular mimicry concept. This concept is supported here by the demonstration of a genetic interaction between eRF1 and the decoding region of the ribosomal RNA, the site of tRNA-mRNA interaction. We show that the conditional lethality caused by a mutation in domain 1 of yeast eRF1 (P86A), that mimics the tRNA anticodon stem-loop, is rescued by compensatory mutations A1491G (rdn15) and U1495C (hyg1) in helix 44 of the decoding region and by U912C (rdn4) and G886A (rdn8) mutations in helix 27 of the 18 S rRNA. The rdn15 mutation creates a C1409-G1491 base-pair in yeast rRNA that is analogous to that in prokaryotic rRNA known to be important for high-affinity paromomycin binding to the ribosome. Indeed, rdn15 makes yeast cells extremely sensitive to paromomycin, indicating that the natural high resistance of the yeast ribosome to paromomycin is, in large part, due to the absence of the 1409-1491 base-pair. The rdn15 and hyg1 mutations also partially compensate for inactivation of the eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) resulting from the formation of the [PSI+] prion, a self-reproducible termination-deficient conformation of eRF3. However, rdn15, but not hyg1, rescues the conditional cell lethality caused by a GTPase domain mutation (R419G) in eRF3. Other antisuppressor rRNA mutations, rdn2(G517A), rdn1T(C1054T) and rdn12A(C526A), strongly inhibit [PSI+]-mediated stop codon read-through but do not cure cells of the [PSI+] prion. Interestingly, cells bearing hyg1 seem to enable [PSI+] strains to accumulate larger Sup35p aggregates upon Sup35p overproduction, suggesting a lower toxicity of overproduced Sup35p when the termination defect, caused by [PSI+], is partly relieved.},

abstract = {In vivo 32P-labeled yeast proteins from wild type and ppz1 ppz2 phosphatase mutants were resolved by bidimensional electrophoresis. A prominent phosphoprotein, which in ppz mutants showed a marked shift to acidic regions, was identified by mixed peptide sequencing as the translation elongation factor 1Balpha (formerly eEF1beta). An equivalent shift was detected in cells overexpressing HAL3, a inhibitory regulatory subunit of Ppz1. Subsequent analysis identified the conserved Ser-86 as the in vivo phosphorylatable residue and showed that its phosphorylation was increased in ppz cells. Pull-down experiments using a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EF1Balpha fusion version allowed to identify Ppz1 as an in vivo interacting protein. Cells lacking Ppz display a higher tolerance to known translation inhibitors, such as hygromycin and paromomycin, and enhanced readthrough at all three nonsense codons, suggesting that translational fidelity might be affected. Overexpression of a GST-EF1Balpha fusion counteracted the growth defect associated to high levels of Ppz1 and this effect was essentially lost when the phosphorylatable Ser-86 is replaced by Ala. Therefore, the Ppz phosphatases appear to regulate the phosphorylation state of EF1Balpha in yeast, and this may result in modification of the translational accuracy.},

abstract = {The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway functions to degrade transcripts containing nonsense codons. Transcripts containing mutations that insert an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5'-UTR are degraded through NMD. However, several naturally occurring uORF-containing transcripts are resistant to NMD. Here we demonstrate that the GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs, which contain uORFs, harbor a stabilizer element (STE) that prevents rapid NMD by interacting with the RNA binding protein Pub1. Conversely, a uORF-containing mRNA that lacks an STE, such as CPA1, is degraded by the NMD pathway. These results indicate that uORFs can play a pivotal role regulating both translation and turnover and that the Pub1p is a critical factor that modulates the stability of uORF-containing transcripts.},

Unexpectedly, we found an interaction in vivo and in vitro between the TFIIIB-recruiting subunit of TFIIIC, tau131, and ABC10alpha, a small essential subunit common to the three forms of nuclear RNA polymerases. This interaction was mapped to the C-terminal region of ABC10alpha. A thermosensitive mutation in the C terminus region of ABC10alpha (rpc10-30) was found to be selectively suppressed by overexpression of a mutant form of tau131 (tau131-DeltaTPR2) that lacks the second TPR repeat. Remarkably, the rpc10-30 mutation weakened the ABC10alpha-tau131 interaction, and the suppressive mutation, tau131-DeltaTPR2 increased the interaction between the two proteins in the two-hybrid assay. These results point to the potential importance of a functional contact between TFIIIC and RNA polymerase III.},

abstract = {Purification of type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) from rabbit skeletal muscle resulted in the isolation of a trimeric phosphatase which is composed of a catalytic (PP2Ac), a structural (PR65alpha/Aalpha), and a regulatory (PR55alpha/Balpha) subunit, together with translation termination factor 1 (eRF1) and another protein of 55 kD (EMBO J., 15, 101-112). Yeast two-hybrid system analysis demonstrated that the eRF1 interacted with PP2Acalpha but not with PR65alpha/Aalpha or PR55alpha/Balpha. The N-terminal region of PP2Acalpha, comprising 50 amino acid residues, and the C-terminal part of eRF1, corresponding to an internal region between amino acids 338-381, were found to be necessary for eRF1--PP2Acalpha interaction in yeast. Immunoprecipitations using 12CA5 antibodies and extracts from COS1 cells transiently transfected with eRF1 tagged with 9-amino acid epitope from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) demonstrated the presence of eRF1--PP2Acalpha--PR65alpha/Aalpha complex in these cells. In addition, polysomes obtained from COS1 cells overexpressing HA--eRF1 displayed several-fold higher PP2A activity than control polysomes. No effect of either PP2Ac or dimeric and trimeric PP2A holoenzymes on the rate of translation termination was detected using an in vitro reconstituted translation termination assay. In summary, eRF1 appears to represent a novel PP2A-targeting subunit that brings this phosphatase in contact with putative ribosomal substrate(s). It remains to be established whether termination of translation requires dephosphorylation of participating protein factor(s).},

In all but one case, pol III subunits were able to interact in vivo with one or sometimes two partner subunits of the enzyme or with subunits of TFIIIC. Four subunits that are common to pol I, II, and III (ABC27, ABC14.5, ABC10alpha, and ABC10beta), two that are common to pol I and III (AC40 and AC19), and one pol III-specific subunit (C11) can associate with defined regions of the two large subunits. These regions overlapped with highly conserved domains. C53, a pol III-specific subunit, interacted with a 37-kDa polypeptide that copurifies with the enzyme and therefore appears to be a unique pol III subunit (C37). Together with parallel interaction studies based on dosage-dependent suppression of conditional mutants, our data suggest a model of the pol III preinitiation complex.},

The polyadenylation of RNA 3' ends is also known to promote degradation by creating a 'toehold' for the degradation machinery. Much remains to be learned about the regulation of mRNA stability.

Mutant TFIIIC was deficient in the activation of certain tRNA genes in vitro, and the transcription defect was selectively alleviated by increasing TBP concentration. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments support a direct interaction between TBP and tau60.

Consistent with their in vivo characteristics, the mutations decreased the productive association of the ribosome with release factor 2 (RF2) and the efficiency of catalysis of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in the presence of RF2 in realistic in vitro termination systems.

abstract = {All eukaryotic cells analyzed have developed mechanisms to eliminate the production of mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation. The mechanisms are thought to exist to protect cells from the deleterious effects of in-frame nonsense codons that are generated by routine inefficiencies and inaccuracies in RNA metabolism such as pre-mRNA splicing. Depending on the particular mRNA and how it is produced, nonsense codons can mediate a reduction in mRNA abundance either (i) before its release from an association with nuclei into the cytoplasm, presumably but not certainly while the mRNA is being exported to the cytoplasm and translated by cytoplasmic ribosomes, or (ii) in the cytoplasm. Here, we provide evidence for a factor that functions to eliminate the production of nonsense-containing RNAs in mammalian cells. The factor, variously referred to as Rent1 (regulator of nonsense transcripts) or HUPF1 (human Upf1 protein), was identified by isolating cDNA for a human homologue to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf1p, which is a group I RNA helicase that functions in the nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA in yeast. Using monkey COS cells and human HeLa cells, we demonstrate that expression of human Upf1 protein harboring an arginine-to-cysteine mutation at residue 844 within the RNA helicase domain acts in a dominant-negative fashion to abrogate the decay of nonsense-containing mRNA that takes place (i) in association with nuclei or (ii) in the cytoplasm. These findings provide evidence that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is related mechanistically in yeast and in mammalian cells, regardless of the cellular site of decay.},

abstract = {Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is a highly conserved ubiquitous protein involved in translation that has been suggested to have desirable properties for phylogenetic inference. To examine the utility of EF-1 alpha as a phylogenetic marker for eukaryotes, we studied three properties of EF-1 alpha trees: congruency with other phyogenetic markers, the impact of species sampling, and the degree of substitutional saturation occurring between taxa. Our analyses indicate that the EF-1 alpha tree is congruent with some other molecular phylogenies in identifying both the deepest branches and some recent relationships in the eukaryotic line of descent. However, the topology of the intermediate portion of the EF-1 alpha tree, occupied by most of the protist lineages, differs for different phylogenetic methods, and bootstrap values for branches are low. Most problematic in this region is the failure of all phylogenetic methods to resolve the monophyly of two higher-order protistan taxa, the Ciliophora and the Alveolata. JACKMONO analyses indicated that the impact of species sampling on bootstrap support for most internal nodes of the eukaryotic EF-1 alpha tree is extreme. Furthermore, a comparison of observed versus inferred numbers of substitutions indicates that multiple overlapping substitutions have occurred, especially on the branch separating the Eukaryota from the Archaebacteria, suggesting that the rooting of the eukaryotic tree on the diplomonad lineage should be treated with caution. Overall, these results suggest that the phylogenies obtained from EF-1 alpha are congruent with other molecular phylogenies in recovering the monophyly of groups such as the Metazoa, Fungi, Magnoliophyta, and Euglenozoa. However, the interrelationships between these and other protist lineages are not well resolved. This lack of resolution may result from the combined effects of poor taxonomic sampling, relatively few informative positions, large numbers of overlapping substitutions that obscure phylogenetic signal, and lineage-specific rate increases in the EF-1 alpha data set. It is also consistent with the nearly simultaneous diversification of major eukaryotic lineages implied by the "big-bang" hypothesis of eukaryote evolution.},

abstract = {Dimorphic growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by the quality of the nitrogen supply. On a preferred nitrogen source diploid cells grow as ellipsoidal cells by using a bipolar pattern of budding, whereas on a poor nitrogen source a unipolar pattern of budding is adopted, resulting in extended pseudohyphal chains of filamentous cells. Here we report that the quality of the nitrogen source is signaled by the glutamine tRNA isoform with a 5'-CUG anticodon (tRNACUG). Mutations that alter this tRNA impair assessment of the nitrogen supply without measurably affecting protein synthesis, so that mutant cells display pseudohyphal growth even on a preferred nitrogen source. The nitrogen status for other nitrogen-responsive processes such as catabolic gene expression and sporulation also is signaled by this tRNA: mutant cells inappropriately induce the nitrogen-repressed gene CAR1 and undergo precocious sporulation in nitrogen-rich media. Therefore, in addition to its role in mRNA translation, this tRNA also transduces nitrogen signals that regulate development.},

abstract = {Efficiency of translation termination is affected if the last two amino acids in the nascent peptide are changed [1,2]. By changing the corresponding codons upstream of the stop signal UGAA, we have analyzed if the -3 to -6 amino acids at the C-terminal region of the nascent peptide also affect termination. Lysine at position -3 gave increased readthrough, whereas a total of 28 variations at positions -4, -5, and -6 showed no significant effect on readthrough. The 3'-ends corresponding to the last six codons in 27 Escherichia coli genes were inserted upstream of a stop codon in the 3A' translation assay gene [1]. Readthrough of the stop codon was measured and a possible correlation with the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) 131 of the respective genes was investigated. Sequences from genes with low CAI do not give any such correlation, whereas sequences from genes with high CAI values are correlated with high termination efficiency. This correlation disappears if the -1 and -2 codons/amino acids are changed. The results suggest that mainly the terminal dipeptide of the terminal hexapeptide sequence has an influence on termination in the tested E. coli genes. This influence is dependent on the charge of the -2 amino acid and is correlated with the alpha-helix propensity of the -1 amino acid, in accordance with results obtained from synthetic gene constructs [1,2].},

abstract = {Two eukaryotic proteins involved in translation termination have recently been characterized in in vitro experiments. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) catalyzes the release of the polypeptide chain without any stop codon specificity. The GTP-binding protein eRF3 confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates eRF1 activity. We used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression at different stop codons in a cat reporter gene to analyze the polypeptide chain release factor activities of the human eRF1 and eRF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. In a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, we measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the human release factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site. Whatever the stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) present in the cat open reading frame, the overexpression of human eRF1 alone markedly decreased translational readthrough by suppressor tRNA. Thus, like the procaryotic release factors RF1 and RF2 in Escherichia coli, eRF1 seems to have an intrinsic antisuppressor activity in human cells. Levels of antisuppression of overexpression of both eRF3 and eRF1 were almost the same as those of overexpression of eRF1 alone, suggesting that eRF1-eRF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the expression level of eRF1. Surprisingly, when overexpressed alone, eRF3 had an inhibitory effect on cat gene expression. The results of cat mRNA stability studies suggest that eRF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. This indicates that in vivo, eRF3 may perform other functions, including the stimulation of eRF1 activity.},

To examine the effects of similar mutations in a eukaryote, all three possible base substitutions and a base deletion were generated at the position of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 18S rRNA corresponding to E. coli C1054. In yeast, as in E. coli, both C1054A (rdn-1A) and C1054G (rdn-1G) caused dominant nonsense suppression. Yeast C1054U (rdn-1T) was a recessive antisuppressor, while yeast C1054-delta (rdn-1delta) led to recessive lethality. Both C1054U and two previously described yeast 18S rRNA antisuppressor mutations, G517A (rdn-2) and U912C (rdn-4), inhibited codon-nonspecific suppression caused by mutations in eukaryotic release factors, sup45 and sup35. However, among these only C1054U inhibited UAA-specific suppressions caused by a UAA-decoding mutant tRNA-Gln (SLT3).

Sequences of 17 different polypeptide release factors from prokaryotes and eukaryotes were compared. The prokaryotic release factors share residues split into seven motifs. Conservation of many discrete, perhaps critical, amino acids is observed in eukaryotic release factors, as well as in the C-terminal portion of elongation factor (EF) G. Given that the C-terminal domains of EF-G interacts with ribosomes by mimicry of a tRNA structure, the pattern of conservation of residues in release factors may reflect requirements for a tRNA-mimicry for binding to the A site of the ribosome. This mimicry would explain why release factors recognize stop codons and suggests that all prokaryotic and eukaryotic release factors evolved from the progenitor of EF-G.},

abstract = {GCN2 is a protein kinase that stimulates translation of GCN4 mRNA in amino acid-starved cells by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIL-2). We isolated multicopy plasmids that overcome the defective derepression of GCN4 and its target genes caused by the leaky mutation gcn2-507. One class of plasmids contained tRNA(His) genes and conferred efficient suppression only when cells were starved for histidine; these plasmids suppressed a gcn2 deletion much less efficiently than they suppressed gcn2-507. This finding indicates that the reduction in GCN4 expression caused by gcn2-507 can be overcome by elevating tRNA(His) expression under conditions in which the excess tRNA cannot be fully aminoacylated. The second class of suppressor plasmids all carried the same gene encoding a mutant form of tRNA(Val) (AAC) with an A-to-G transition at the 3' encoded nucleotide, a mutation shown previously to reduce aminoacylation of tRNA(Val) in vitro. In contrast to the wild-type tRNA(His) genes, the mutant tRNA(Val) gene efficiently suppressed a gcn2 deletion, and this suppression was independent of the phosphorylation site on eIF-2 alpha (Ser-51). Overexpression of the mutant tRNA(Val) did, however, stimulate GCN4 expression at the translational level. We propose that the multicopy mutant tRNA(Val) construct leads to an accumulation of uncharged tRNA(Val) that derepresses GCN4 translation through a pathway that does not involve GCN2 or eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. This GCN2-independent pathway was also stimulated to a lesser extent by the multicopy tRNA(His) constructs in histidine-deprived cells. Because the mutant tRNA(Val) exacerbated the slow-growth phenotype associated with eIF-2 alpha hyperphosphorylation by an activated GCN2c kinase, we suggest that the GCN2-independent derepression mechanism involves down-regulation of eIF-2 activity.},

abstract = {The role of acceptor stem base pairs in determining the identity of Escherichia coli tRNA(Trp) was examined by complementation of an E. coli strain containing a temperature-sensitive tRNA(Trp) gene (trpTts) and by monitoring aminoacylation levels in vivo. All derivatives of tRNA(Trp) containing substitutions at the first 3 base pairs in the acceptor stem complemented the trpTts mutation at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C). However, three acceptor stem derivatives (tRNA(Trp)/C1.G72, tRNA(Trp)/C2.G71, and tRNA(Trp)/A3.U70) required overexpression for growth at 42 degrees C. Northern analysis of these derivatives following acid/urea gel electrophoresis showed no defects in tRNA aminoacylation at the nonpermissive temperature. Instead, these tRNAs appear to be defective in translation. This was suggested by the weak opal suppressor activities of the corresponding tRNA(UCATrp) derivatives. These results demonstrate that the three terminal acceptor stem base pairs do not contribute to the identity of tRNA(Trp). Substitution of the C1.A72 base pair in a methionine initiator tRNA containing the tryptophan anticodon and discriminator base (tRNA(CCAfMet)/G73) with A1.U72, the base pair found in tRNA(Trp), or G1.C72 resulted in the conversion of these tRNAs into tryptophan-inserting elongator tRNAs in vivo. However, changes to U1.A72 or C1.G72 in tRNA(CCAfMet)/G73 resulted in misaminoacylation and/or defects in translation. Our data indicate that the A1.U72 base pair is a context-dependent, negative identity element of tRNA(Trp).},

Twelve mRNA analogues containing 4-thiouridine residues as part of stop signals were synthesized. Highly efficient cross-linking to RF-2 from 4-thiouridine (sU) residues of sUGAN-containing mRNAs was observed, and cross-linking from those of sUAAN was observed at a lower efficiency. This indicates that RF-2 is in close physical contact with the stop signal on the ribosome. The yield of the RF-2-mRNA cross-link depended on the identity of the fourth base for the sUGAN set of signals, suggesting that the fourth base of the stop signal affects the interaction between RF-2 and the stop codon. A region previously implicated as part of the decoding site of the small ribosomal subunit, 1385-1420 of the 16 S rRNA, was also cross-linked with these mRNAs. No new cross-links were obtained in the presence of the release factor. The data are consistent with models in which the RF has an anticodon-like domain that contacts the stop signal directly at or near the ribosomal site in which sense codons are decoded.},

Through the analysis of chimeric transcripts and internal deletions, we have identified a 65-nucleotide segment of the MAT alpha 1 mRNA coding region, termed the MAT alpha 1 instability element, that is sufficient to confer instability to a stable PGK1 reporter transcript and that accelerates turnover of the unstable MAT alpha 1 mRNA. This 65-nucleotide element is composed of two parts, one located within the 5' 33 nucleotides and the second located in the 3' 32 nucleotides. The first part, which can be functionally replaced by sequences containing rare codons, is unable to promote rapid decay by itself but can enhance the action of the 3' 32 nucleotides (positions 234 to 266 in the MAT alpha 1 mRNA) in accelerating turnover. A second portion of the MAT alpha 1 mRNA (nucleotides 265 to 290) is also sufficient to destabilize the PGK1 reporter transcript when positioned 3' of rare codons, suggesting that the 3' half of the MAT alpha 1 instability element is functionally reiterated within the MAT alpha 1 mRNA.

When expressed in a sup45 mutant, the Xenopus Cl1 cDNA was able to suppress sup45-related phenotypes, showing that the structural homology reflects a functional homology. Our discovery of a structural and functional homolog in Xenopus cells implies that the function of SUP45 is not restricted to lower eukaryotes and that the SUP45 protein may perform a crucial cellular function in higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the TEA transcription factor Tec1 controls several developmental programs in response to nutrients and pheromones. Tec1 is targeted by the pheromone-responsive Fus3/Kss1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which destabilizes the transcription factor to ensure efficient mating of sexual partner cells. The regulation of Tec1 by signaling pathways that control cell division and development in response to nutrients, however, is not known. Here, we show that Tec1 protein stability is under control of the nutrient-sensitive target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway via the Tip41-Tap42-Sit4 branch. We further show that degradation of Tec1 upon inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin does not involve polyubiquitylation and appears to be proteasome independent. However, rapamycin-induced Tec1 degradation depends on the HECT ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, which physically interacts with Tec1 via conserved PxY motives. We further demonstrate that rapamycin and mating pheromone control Tec1 protein stability through distinct mechanisms by targeting different domains of the transcription factor. Finally, we show that Tec1 is a positive regulator of yeast chronological lifespan (CLS), a known TORC1-regulated process. Our findings indicate that in yeast, Tec1 links TORC1 and MAPK signaling pathways to coordinate control of cellular development in response to different stimuli.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic peptide release factor 3 (eRF3) is a conserved, essential gene in eukaryotes implicated in translation termination. We have systematically measured the contribution of eRF3 to the rates of peptide release with both saturating and limiting levels of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1). Although eRF3 modestly stimulates the absolute rate of peptide release (∼5-fold), it strongly increases the rate of peptide release when eRF1 is limiting (>20-fold). This effect was generalizable across all stop codons and in a variety of contexts. Further investigation revealed that eRF1 remains associated with ribosomal complexes after peptide release and subunit dissociation and that eRF3 promotes the dissociation of eRF1 from these post-termination complexes. These data are consistent with models where eRF3 principally affects binding interactions between eRF1 and the ribosome, either prior to or subsequent to peptide release. A role for eRF3 as an escort for eRF1 into its fully accommodated state is easily reconciled with its close sequence similarity to the translational GTPase EFTu.},

abstract = {The yeast transcription factor Ste12 controls both mating and filamentation pathways. Upon pheromone induction, the mitogen-activated protein kinases, Fus3 and Kss1, activate Ste12 by relieving the repression of two functionally redundant Ste12 inhibitors, Dig1 and Dig2. Mating genes are controlled by the Ste12/Dig1/Dig2 complex through Ste12-binding sites, whereas filamentation genes are regulated by the Tec1/Ste12/Dig1 complex through Tec1-binding sites. The two Ste12 complexes are mutually exclusive. During pheromone response, Tec1 is degraded upon phosphorylation by Fus3, preventing cross-activation of the filamentation pathway. Here, we show that a stable Tec1 also impairs the induction of mating genes. A mathematical model is developed to capture the dynamic formation of the two Ste12 complexes and their interactions with pathway-specific promoters. By model simulations and experimentation, we show that excess Tec1 can impair the mating transcriptional output because of its ability to sequester Ste12, and because of a novel function of Dig2 for the transcription of mating genes. We suggest that Fus3-triggered Tec1 degradation is an important part of the transcriptional induction of mating genes during the pheromone response.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic transcription activation domains (ADs) are not well defined on the proteome scale. We systematicallly tested approximately 6000 yeast proteins for transcriptional activity using a yeast one-hybrid system and identified 451 transcriptional activators. We then determined their transcription activation strength using fusions to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a His3 reporter gene which contained a promoter with a Gal4-binding site. Among the 132 strongest activators 32 are known transcription factors while another 35 have no known function. Although zinc fingers, helix-loop-helix domains and several other domains are highly overrepresented among the activators, only few contain characterized ADs. We also found some striking correlations: the stronger the activation activity, the more acidic, glutamine-rich, proline-rich or asparagine-rich the activators were. About 29{\%} of the activators have been found previously to specifically interact with the transcription machinery, while 10{\%} are known to be components of transcription regulatory complexes. Based on their transcriptional activity, localization and interaction patterns, at least six previously uncharacterized proteins are suggested to be bona fide transcriptional regulators (namely YFL049W, YJR070C, YDR520C, YGL066W/Sgf73, YKR064W and YCR082W/Ahc2).},

This condition-dependent distribution of Ste12 requires concurrent binding of the transcription factor Tec1 during filamentation and is differentially regulated by the MAP kinases Fus3 and Kss1.

abstract = {Like all microorganisms, yeast cells spend most of their natural lifetime in a reversible, quiescent state that is primarily induced by limitation for essential nutrients. Substantial progress has been made in defining the features of quiescent cells and the nutrient-signaling pathways that shape these features. A view that emerges from the wealth of new data is that yeast cells dynamically configure the quiescent state in response to nutritional challenges by using a set of key nutrient-signaling pathways, which (1) regulate pathway-specific effectors, (2) converge on a few regulatory nodes that bundle multiple inputs to communicate unified, graded responses, and (3) mutually modulate their competences to transmit signals. Here, I present an overview of our current understanding of the architecture of these pathways, focusing on how the corresponding core signaling protein kinases (i.e. PKA, TORC1, Snf1, and Pho85) are wired to ensure an adequate response to nutrient starvation, which enables cells to tide over decades, if not centuries, of famine.},

Several antisense transcripts are known to be conserved across various species of yeast, and a few antisense transcripts are associated with functional regulation of the sense transcript. We detect antisense transcription from approximately 90{\%} of protein-coding genes, and antisense transcription is generally associated with histone modifications indicative of a transcriptionally active state. The pattern of genome-wide antisense transcription in two species of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, is widely evolutionarily conserved: Antisense transcripts exhibit conserved expression levels and localization with respect to gene annotations. Regions of genes exhibiting conserved antisense transcription also show less sequence divergence than regions of genes without antisense transcription. These findings provide further support that widespread antisense transcription is functional in yeast, and expand the catalog of putative functional antisense transcripts to include nonpolyadenylated transcripts. Because antisense transcripts are less divergent in sequence than expected, they likely contain sequences important to their function.},

abstract = {Gene transcription is constrained by the nucleosomal nature of chromosomal DNA. This nucleosomal barrier is modulated by FACT, a conserved histone-binding heterodimer. FACT mediates transcription-linked nucleosome disassembly and also nucleosome reassembly in the wake of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex, and in this way maintains the repression of 'cryptic' promoters found within some genes. Here we focus on a novel mutant version of the yeast FACT subunit Spt16 that supplies essential Spt16 activities but impairs transcription-linked nucleosome reassembly in dominant fashion. This Spt16 mutant protein also has genetic effects that are recessive, which we used to show that certain Spt16 activities collaborate with histone acetylation and the activities of a Bur-kinase/Spt4-Spt5/Paf1C pathway that facilitate transcription elongation. These collaborating activities were opposed by the actions of Rpd3S, a histone deacetylase that restores a repressive chromatin environment in a transcription-linked manner. Spt16 activity paralleling that of HirC, a co-repressor of histone gene expression, was also found to be opposed by Rpd3S. Our findings suggest that Spt16, the Bur/Spt4-Spt5/Paf1C pathway, and normal histone abundance and/or stoichiometry, in mutually cooperative fashion, facilitate nucleosome disassembly during transcription elongation. The recessive nature of these effects of the mutant Spt16 protein on transcription-linked nucleosome disassembly, contrasted to its dominant negative effect on transcription-linked nucleosome reassembly, indicate that mutant FACT harbouring the mutant Spt16 protein competes poorly with normal FACT at the stage of transcription-linked nucleosome disassembly, but effectively with normal FACT for transcription-linked nucleosome reassembly. This functional difference is consistent with the idea that FACT association with the transcription elongation complex depends on nucleosome disassembly, and that the same FACT molecule that associates with an elongation complex through nucleosome disassembly is retained for reassembly of the same nucleosome.},

abstract = {Histones, the fundamental packaging elements of eukaryotic DNA, are highly decorated with a diverse set of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are recognized to govern the structure and function of chromatin. Ten years ago, we put forward the histone code hypothesis, which provided a model to explain how single and/or combinatorial PTMs on histones regulate the diverse activities associated with chromatin (e.g., gene transcription). At that time, there was a limited understanding of both the number of PTMs that occur on histones and the proteins that place, remove, and interpret them. Since the conception of this hypothesis, the field has witnessed an unprecedented advance in our understanding of the enzymes that contribute to the establishment of histone PTMs, as well as the diverse effector proteins that bind them. While debate continues as to whether histone PTMs truly constitute a strict "code," it is becoming clear that PTMs on histone proteins function in elaborate combinations to regulate the many activities associated with chromatin. In this special issue, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the landmark publication of the lac operon with a review that provides a current view of the histone code hypothesis, the lessons we have learned over the last decade, and the technologies that will drive our understanding of histone PTMs forward in the future.},

abstract = {Histone modifications are a crucial source of epigenetic control. SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) is a chromatin-modifying complex that contains two distinct enzymatic activities, Gcn5 and Ubp8, through which it acetylates and deubiquitinates histone residues, respectively, thereby enforcing a pattern of modifications that is decisive in regulating gene expression. Here, I discuss the latest contributions to understanding the roles of the SAGA complex, highlighting the characterization of the SAGA-deubiquitination module, and emphasizing the functions newly ascribed to SAGA during transcription elongation and messenger-RNA export. These findings suggest that a crosstalk exists between chromatin remodelling, transcription and messenger-RNA export, which could constitute a checkpoint for accurate gene expression. I focus particularly on the new components of human SAGA, which was recently discovered and confirms the conservation of the SAGA complex throughout evolution.},

More recently, functional gene clustering has been reported in eukaryotes, from yeasts to filamentous fungi, plants, and animals. Gene clusters can consist of paralogous genes that have most likely arisen by gene duplication. However, there are now many examples of eukaryotic gene clusters that contain functionally related but non-homologous genes and that represent functional gene organizations with operon-like features (physical clustering and co-regulation). These include gene clusters for use of different carbon and nitrogen sources in yeasts, for production of antibiotics, toxins, and virulence determinants in filamentous fungi, for production of defense compounds in plants, and for innate and adaptive immunity in animals (the major histocompatibility locus). The aim of this article is to review features of functional gene clusters in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and the significance of clustering for effective function.},

abstract = {There are a number of well-characterized and fundamental roles for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in gene regulation in all kingdoms of life. ncRNAs, such as ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, and small interfering RNAs, can serve catalytic and scaffolding functions in transcription, messenger RNA processing, translation, and RNA degradation. Recently, our understanding of gene expression has been dramatically challenged by the identification of large and diverse populations of novel ncRNAs in the eukaryotic genomes surveyed thus far. Studies carried out using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that at least some coding genes are regulated by these novel ncRNAs. S. cerevisiae lacks RNA interference (RNAi) and, thus, provides an ideal system for studying the RNAi-independent mechanisms of ncRNA-based gene regulation. The current picture of gene regulation is one of great unknowns, in which the transcriptional environment surrounding a given locus may have as much to do with its regulation as its DNA sequence or local chromatin structure. Drawing on the recent research in S. cerevisiae and other organisms, this review will discuss the identification of ncRNAs, their origins and processing, and several models that incorporate ncRNAs into the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure.},

Specific sets of these genes can be transcribed co-ordinately in response to particular metabolic signals. The resultant integrated response to nutrient challenge allows the organism to survive and flourish in a variety of environmental conditions while minimal energy is expended upon the production of unnecessary proteins. The Zn(II)2Cys6 family of transcriptional regulators is composed of some 46 members in S. cerevisiae and many of these have been implicated in mediating transcriptional responses to specific nutrients. Gal4p, the archetypical member of this family, is responsible for the expression of the GAL genes when galactose is utilized as a carbon source. The regulation of Gal4p activity has been studied for many years, but we are still uncovering both nuances and fundamental control mechanisms that impinge on its function. In the present review, we describe the latest developments in the regulation of GAL gene expression and compare the mechanisms employed here with the molecular control of other Zn(II)2Cys6 transcriptional regulators. This reveals a wide array of protein-protein, protein-DNA and protein-nutrient interactions that are employed by this family of regulators.},

The enormous regulatory potential of histone modification is illustrated in the vast array of epigenetic markers found throughout the genome. More than the other types of histone modification, acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues on N-terminal histone tails are fundamental for the formation of chromatin domains, such as euchromatin, and facultative and constitutive heterochromatin. In addition, the modification of histones can cause a region of chromatin to undergo nuclear compartmentalization and, as such, specific epigenetic markers are non-randomly distributed within interphase nuclei. In this review, we summarize the principles behind epigenetic compartmentalization and the functional consequences of chromatin arrangement within interphase nuclei.},

This component plays a key role both in the stimulation of basal transcription and in the regulation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator complex was the first to be studied and consists of at least 20 different subunits with multiple activities. Afterwards, its subunit composition was determined and related functions of C. elegans, Drosophila and mammalian complexes show a striking evolutionary conservation both of the structure and function from yeast to man. Recently, yeast studies strongly suggest additional roles for Mediator in coordinating transcription initiation with downstream transcriptional events in the coding region of genes; consequently, new models of recruitment-coupled regulation have been indicated. Further studies on transcription machinery should expand our knowledge of the pathways in which variant components of Mediator, or variant proteins interacting directly or in complexes, represent risk factors for complex inheritable disease.},

@article{Wittenberg2005,
abstract = {In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a significant fraction of genes (>10{\%}) are transcribed with cell cycle periodicity. These genes encode critical cell cycle regulators as well as proteins with no direct connection to cell cycle functions. Cell cycle-regulated genes can be organized into 'clusters' exhibiting similar patterns of regulation. In most cases periodic transcription is achieved via both repressive and activating mechanisms. Fine-tuning appears to have evolved by the juxtaposition of regulatory motifs characteristic of more than one cluster within the same promoter. Recent reports have provided significant new insight into the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28) in coordination of transcription with cell cycle events. In early G1, the transcription factor complex known as SBF is maintained in a repressed state by association of the Whi5 protein. Phosphorylation of Whi5 by Cdk1 in late G1 leads to dissociation from SBF and transcriptional derepression. G2/M-specific transcription is achieved by converting the repressor Fkh2 into an activator. Fkh2 serves as a repressor during most of the cell cycle. However, phosphorylation of a cofactor, Ndd1, by Cdk1 late in the cell cycle promotes binding to Fkh2 and conversion into a transcriptional activator. Such insights derived from analysis of specific genes when combined with genome-wide analysis provide a more detailed and integrated view of cell cycle-dependent transcription.},

When used to search upstream of apparently coregulated genes, AlignACE finds motifs that often correspond to the DNA binding preferences of transcription factors. We previously used AlignACE to analyze whole genome mRNA expression data. Here, we present a more detailed study of its effectiveness as applied to a variety of groups of genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Published functional catalogs of genes and sets of genes grouped by common name provided 248 groups, resulting in 3311 motifs. In conjunction with this analysis, we present measures for gauging the tendency of a motif to target a given set of genes relative to all other genes in the genome and for gauging the degree to which a motif is preferentially located in a certain distance range upstream of translational start sites. We demonstrate improved methods for comparing and clustering sequence motifs. Many previously identified cis-regulatory elements were found. We also describe previously unidentified motifs, one of which has been verified by experiments in our laboratory. An extensive set of AlignACE runs on randomly selected sets of genes and on sets of genes whose upstream regions contain known transcription factor binding sites serve as controls.},

abstract = {Tolerance to desiccation in cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is inducible; only one in a million cells from an exponential culture survive desiccation compared with one in five cells in stationary phase. Here we exploit the desiccation sensitivity of exponentially dividing cells to understand the stresses imposed by desiccation and their stress response pathways. We found that induction of desiccation tolerance is cell autonomous and that there is an inverse correlation between desiccation tolerance and growth rate in glucose-, ammonia-, or phosphate-limited continuous cultures. A transient heat shock induces a 5000-fold increase in desiccation tolerance, whereas hyper-ionic, -reductive, -oxidative, or -osmotic stress induced much less. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Sch9p-regulated branch of the TOR and Ras-cAMP pathway inhibits desiccation tolerance by inhibiting the stress response transcription factors Gis1p, Msn2p, and Msn4p and by activating Sfp1p, a ribosome biogenesis transcription factor. Among 41 mutants defective in ribosome biogenesis, a subset defective in 60S showed a dramatic increase in desiccation tolerance independent of growth rate. We suggest that reduction of a specific intermediate in 60S biogenesis, resulting from conditions such as heat shock and nutrient deprivation, increases desiccation tolerance.},

abstract = {The Gene Promoter Expression Prediction challenge consisted of predicting gene expression from promoter sequences in a previously unknown experimentally generated data set. The challenge was presented to the community in the framework of the sixth Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM6), a community effort to evaluate the status of systems biology modeling methodologies. Nucleotide-specific promoter activity was obtained by measuring fluorescence from promoter sequences fused upstream of a gene for yellow fluorescence protein and inserted in the same genomic site of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-one teams submitted results predicting the expression levels of 53 different promoters from yeast ribosomal protein genes. Analysis of participant predictions shows that accurate values for low-expressed and mutated promoters were difficult to obtain, although in the latter case, only when the mutation induced a large change in promoter activity compared to the wild-type sequence. As in previous DREAM challenges, we found that aggregation of participant predictions provided robust results, but did not fare better than the three best algorithms. Finally, this study not only provides a benchmark for the assessment of methods predicting activity of a specific set of promoters from their sequence, but it also shows that the top performing algorithm, which used machine-learning approaches, can be improved by the addition of biological features such as transcription factor binding sites.},

In the current study, we applied gTOW to the analysis of all protein-coding genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that the yeast cellular system was robust against an increase in the copy number by up to 100 copies in >80{\%} of the genes. After frameshift and segmentation analyses, we isolated 115 dosage-sensitive genes (DSGs) with copy number limits of 10 or less. DSGs contained a significant number of genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport. DSGs tended to be highly expressed and to encode protein complex members. We demonstrated that the protein burden caused the dosage sensitivity of highly expressed genes using a gTOW experiment in which the open reading frame was replaced with GFP. Dosage sensitivities of some DSGs were rescued by the simultaneous increase in the copy numbers of partner genes, indicating that stoichiometric imbalances among complexes cause dosage sensitivity. The results obtained in this study will provide basic knowledge about the physiology of chromosomal abnormalities and the evolution of chromosomal composition.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae can survive extreme desiccation, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. To define genes involved in desiccation tolerance, two complementary genome-wide approaches, phenomics and transcriptomics, have been used, together with a targeted analysis of gene deletion mutants tested individually for their ability to survive drying. Genome-wide phenotypic analyses carried out on a pooled library of single-gene deletion mutants subjected to three cycles of desiccation and re-growth to post-diauxic phase identified about 650 genes that contributed to strain survival in the drying process. Air-drying desiccation-tolerant post-diauxic phase cells significantly altered transcription in 12{\%} of the yeast genome, activating expression of over 450 genes and down-regulating 330. Autophagy processes were significantly over-represented in both the phenomics study and the genes up-regulated on drying, indicating the importance of the clearance of protein aggregates/damaged organelles and the recycling of nutrients for the survival of desiccation in yeast. Functional carbon source sensing networks governed by the PKA, Tor and Snf1 protein kinase complexes were important for the survival of desiccation, as indicated by phenomics, transcriptomics, and individual analyses of mutant strains. Changes in nitrogen metabolism were evident during the drying process and parts of the environmental stress response were activated, repressing ribosome production and inducing genes for coping with oxidative and osmotic stress.},

abstract = {The regulation of ribosomal protein (RP) gene transcription is tightly linked to the nutrient status of the cell and is under the control of metabolic signaling pathways. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae several transcriptional activators mediate efficient RP gene transcription during logarithmic growth and dissociate from RP gene promoters upon nutrient limitation. Repression of RP gene transcription appears to be regulated predominantly by posttranslational modification and cellular localization of transcriptional activators. We report here that one of these factors, Sfp1, is degraded by the proteasome and that the proteasome activator Blm10 is required for regulated Sfp1 degradation. Loss of Blm10 results in the stabilization and increased nuclear abundance of Sfp1 during nutrient limitation, increased transcription of RP genes, increased levels of RPs, and decreased rapamycin-induced repression of RP genes. Thus we conclude that proteasomal degradation of Sfp1 is mediated by Blm10 and contributes to the repression of ribosome biogenesis under nutrient depletion.},

The response logic of the cells to heat shock is still not entirely clear. In this study, we combined the expression profiles with metabolic pathways to investigate the logical relations between heat shock response metabolic pathways. The results showed that the heat-stressed S. cerevisiae cell accumulated trehalose and glycogen, which protect cellular proteins against denaturation, and modulate its phospholipid structure to sustain stability of the cell wall. The TCA cycle was enhanced, and the heat shock-induced turnover of amino acids and nucleotides served to meet the extra energy requirement due to heat-induced protein metabolism and modification. The enhanced respiration led to oxidative stress, and subsequently induced the aldehyde detoxification system. These results indicated that new insight into the response logic of S. cerevisiae to heat shock can be gained by integrating expression profiles and the logical relations between heat shock response metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {The coupling of environmental conditions to cell growth and division is integral to cell fitness. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factor Sfp1 couples nutrient status to cell growth rate by controlling the expression of ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) and ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Sfp1 is localized to the nucleus in rich nutrients, but upon nutrient limitation or target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway inhibition by rapamycin, Sfp1 rapidly exits the nucleus, leading to repression of the Ribi/RP regulons. Through systematic cell-based screens we found that many components of the secretory system influence Sfp1 localization. Notably, the essential Rab escort protein Mrs6 exhibited a nutrient-sensitive interaction with Sfp1. Overexpression of Mrs6 prevented nuclear localization of Sfp1 in rich nutrients, whereas loss of Mrs6 resulted in nuclear Sfp1 localization in poor nutrients. These effects were specific to Sfp1 and independent of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, suggesting that Mrs6 lies in a distinct branch of TOR and ribosome biogenesis regulation. Rapamycin-resistant alleles of MRS6 were defective in the cytoplasmic retention of Sfp1, the control of cell size, and in the repression of the Ribi/RP regulons. The Sfp1-Mrs6 interaction is a nexus for growth regulation that links the secretory system and TOR-dependent nutrient signaling to ribosome biogenesis.},

Several autoregulatory mechanisms controlling various aspects of ribosome biogenesis have been uncovered and reveal new connections to cell-cycle and cell-size control.

The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase is part of a highly conserved signaling pathway linking nutritional and stress signals to regulation of ribosomal protein (RP) and ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) gene transcription. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the downstream effectors of TOR is Sfp1, a transcriptional activator that regulates both RP and Ribi genes. Here, we report that Sfp1 interacts directly with TOR complex 1 (TORC1) in a rapamycin-regulated manner, and that phosphorylation of Sfp1 by this kinase complex regulates its function. Sfp1, in turn, negatively regulates TORC1 phosphorylation of Sch9, another key TORC1 target that acts in parallel with Sfp1, revealing a feedback mechanism controlling the activity of these proteins. Finally, we show that the Sfp1-interacting protein Mrs6, a Rab escort protein involved in membrane trafficking, regulates both Sfp1 nuclear localization and TORC1 signaling.},

Here, we present a new long-lived yeast deletion mutation,afo1 (for aging factor one), that confers a 60{\%} increase in replicative lifespan. AFO1/MRPL25 codes for a protein that is contained in the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Double mutant experiments indicate that the longevity-increasing action of the afo1 mutation is independent of mitochondrial translation, yet involves the cytoplasmic Tor1p as well as the growth-controlling transcription factor Sfp1p. In their final cell cycle, the long-lived mutant cells do show the phenotypes of yeast apoptosis indicating that the longevity of the mutant is not caused by an inability to undergo programmed cell death. Furthermore, the afo1 mutation displays high resistance against oxidants. Despite the respiratory deficiency the mutant has paradoxical increase in growth rate compared to generic petite mutants. A comparison of the single and double mutant strains for afo1 and fob1 shows that the longevity phenotype of afo1 is independent of the formation of ERCs (ribosomal DNA minicircles).

Large numbers of TF binding motifs have been revealed by ChIP-chip experiments followed by computational DNA motif discovery. However, the success of motif discovery algorithms has been limited when applied to sequences bound in vivo (such as those identified by ChIP-chip) because the observed TF-DNA interactions are not necessarily direct: Some TFs predominantly associate with DNA indirectly through protein partners, while others exhibit both direct and indirect binding. Here, we present the first method for distinguishing between direct and indirect TF-DNA interactions, integrating in vivo TF binding data, in vivo nucleosome occupancy data, and motifs from in vitro protein binding microarray experiments. When applied to yeast ChIP-chip data, our method reveals that only 48{\%} of the data sets can be readily explained by direct binding of the profiled TF, while 16{\%} can be explained by indirect DNA binding. In the remaining 36{\%}, none of the motifs used in our analysis was able to explain the ChIP-chip data, either because the data were too noisy or because the set of motifs was incomplete. As more in vitro TF DNA binding motifs become available, our method could be used to build a complete catalog of direct and indirect TF-DNA interactions. Our method is not restricted to yeast or to ChIP-chip data, but can be applied in any system for which both in vivo binding data and in vitro DNA binding motifs are available.},

@article{VandenBrink2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The capacity of respiring cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to immediately switch to fast alcoholic fermentation upon a transfer to anaerobic sugar-excess conditions is a key characteristic of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in many of its industrial applications. This transition was studied by exposing aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a low specific growth rate to two simultaneous perturbations: oxygen depletion and relief of glucose limitation.

RESULTS: The shift towards fully fermentative conditions caused a massive transcriptional reprogramming, where one third of all genes within the genome were transcribed differentially. The changes in transcript levels were mostly driven by relief from glucose-limitation. After an initial strong response to the addition of glucose, the expression profile of most transcriptionally regulated genes displayed a clear switch at 30 minutes. In this respect, a striking difference was observed between the transcript profiles of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and those encoding ribosomal biogenesis components. Not all regulated genes responded with this binary profile. A group of 87 genes showed a delayed and steady increase in expression that specifically responded to anaerobiosis.

CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that, despite the complexity of this multiple-input perturbation, the transcriptional responses could be categorized and biologically interpreted. By comparing this study with public datasets representing dynamic and steady conditions, 14 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated genes were determined to be anaerobic specific. Therefore, these can be seen as true "signature" transcripts for anaerobicity under dynamic as well as under steady state conditions.},

abstract = {Unicellular organisms such as yeasts have evolved to survive environmental stresses by rapidly reorganizing the genomic expression program to meet the challenges of harsh environments. The complex adaptation mechanisms to stress remain to be elucidated. In this study, we developed Stress Transcription Factor Identification Algorithm (STFIA), which integrates gene expression and TF-gene association data to identify the stress transcription factors (TFs) of six kinds of stresses. We identified some general stress TFs that are in response to various stresses, and some specific stress TFs that are in response to one specific stress. The biological significance of our findings is validated by the literature. We found that a small number of TFs may be sufficient to control a wide variety of expression patterns in yeast under different stresses. Two implications can be inferred from this observation. First, the adaptation mechanisms to different stresses may have a bow-tie structure. Second, there may exist extensive regulatory cross-talk among different stress responses. In conclusion, this study proposes a network of the regulators of stress responses and their mechanism of action.},

abstract = {The global gene transcription pattern of the eukaryotic experimental model Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to sudden aggression with the widely used herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was analysed. Under acute stress, 14{\%} of the yeast transcripts suffered a greater than twofold change. The yeastract database was used to predict the transcription factors mediating the response registered in this microarray analysis. Most of the up-regulated genes in response to 2,4-D are known targets of Msn2p, Msn4p, Yap1p, Pdr1p, Pdr3p, Stp1p, Stp2p and Rpn4p. The major regulator of ribosomal protein genes, Sfp1p, is known to control 60{\%} of the down-regulated genes, in particular many involved in the transcriptional and translational machinery and in cell division. The yeast response to the herbicide includes the increased expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, the recovery or degradation of damaged proteins, cell wall remodelling and multiple drug resistance. Although the protective role of TPO1 and PDR5 genes was confirmed, the majority of the responsive genes encoding multidrug resistance do not confer resistance to 2,4-D. The increased expression of genes involved in alternative carbon and nitrogen source metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation and autophagy was also registered, suggesting that acute herbicide stress leads to nutrient limitation.},

abstract = {The story of rapamycin is a pharmaceutical fairytale. Discovered as an antifungal activity in a soil sample collected on Easter Island, this macrocyclic lactone and its derivatives are now billion dollar drugs, used in, and being evaluated for, a number of clinical applications. Taking advantage of its antifungal property, the molecular Target Of Rapamycin, TOR, was first described in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TORs encode large, Ser/Thr protein kinases that reside in two distinct, structurally and functionally conserved, multi-protein complexes. In yeast, these complexes coordinate many different aspects of cell growth. TOR complex 1, TORC1, promotes protein synthesis and other anabolic processes, while inhibiting macroautophagy and other catabolic and stress-response processes. TORC2 primarily regulates cell polarity, although additional readouts of this complex are beginning to be characterized. TORC1 appears to be activated by nutrient cues and inhibited by stresses and rapamycin; however, detailed mechanisms are not known. In contrast, TORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin and physiological regulators of this complex have yet to be defined. Given the unsurpassed resources available to yeast researchers, this simple eukaryote continues to contribute to our understanding of eukaryotic cell growth in general and TOR function in particular.},

To identify these sequences, we developed an algorithm that searches for short, conserved sequence motifs in the genomes of related species. The method is effective in finding motifs de novo and for refining known regulatory motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We tested one novel motif prediction of the algorithm and found it to be the binding site of Stp2; it is significantly different from the previously predicted Stp2 binding site. We show that Stp2 physically interacts with this sequence motif, and that stp2 mutations affect the expression of genes associated with the motif. We demonstrate that the Stp2 binding site also interacts genetically with Stp1, a regulator of amino acid permease genes and, with Sfp1, a key regulator of cell growth. These results illuminate an important transcriptional circuit that regulates cell growth through external nutrient uptake.},

abstract = {HOT1 is a mitotic recombination hotspot derived from yeast rDNA. To further study HOT1 function, trans-acting H OT1 recombination mutants (hrm) that alter hotspot activity were isolated. hrm2-1 mutants have decreased HOT1 activity and grow slowly. The HRM2 gene was cloned and found to be identical to SCH9, a gene that affects a growth-control mechanism that is partially redundant with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Deletion of SCH9 decreases HOT1 and rDNA recombination but not other mitotic exchange. Although high levels of RNA polymerase I transcription initiated at HOT1 are required for its recombination-stimulating activity, sch9 mutations do not affect transcription initiated within HOT1. Thus, transcription is necessary but not sufficient for HOT1 activity. TPK1, which encodes a catalytic subunit of PKA, is a multicopy suppressor of the recombination and growth defects of sch9 mutants, suggesting that increased PKA activity compensates for SCH9 loss. RAS2( val19), which codes for a hyperactive RAS protein and increases PKA activity, suppresses both phenotypic defects of sch9 mutants. In contrast to TPK1 and RAS2(val19), the gene for split zinc finger protein 1 (SFP1) on a multicopy vector suppresses only the growth defects of sch9 mutants, indicating that growth and HOT1 functions of Sch9p are separable. Sch9p may affect signal transduction pathways which regulate proteins that are specifically required for HOT1-stimulated exchange.},

abstract = {Cell-size homeostasis entails a fundamental balance between growth and division. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae establishes this balance by enforcing growth to a critical cell size prior to cell cycle commitment (Start) in late G1 phase. Nutrients modulate the critical size threshold, such that cells are large in rich medium and small in poor medium. Here, we show that two potent negative regulators of Start, Sfp1 and Sch9, are activators of the ribosomal protein (RP) and ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) regulons, the transcriptional programs that dictate ribosome synthesis rate in accord with environmental and intracellular conditions. Sfp1 and Sch9 are required for carbon-source modulation of cell size and are regulated at the level of nuclear localization and abundance, respectively. Sfp1 nuclear concentration responds rapidly to nutrient and stress conditions and is regulated by the Ras/PKA and TOR signaling pathways. In turn, Sfp1 influences the nuclear localization of Fhl1 and Ifh1, which bind to RP gene promoters. Starvation or the absence of Sfp1 causes Fhl1 and Ifh1 to localize to nucleolar regions, concomitant with reduced RP gene transcription. These findings suggest that nutrient signals set the critical cell-size threshold via Sfp1 and Sch9-mediated control of ribosome biosynthetic rates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The yeast ribosomal protein S9 (S9) is located at the entrance tunnel of the mRNA into the ribosome. It is known to play a role in accurate decoding and its bacterial homolog (S4) has recently been shown to be involved in opening RNA duplexes. Here we examined the effects of changing the C terminus of S9, which is rich in acidic amino acids and extends out of the ribosome surface.

RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide analysis to reveal effects at the transcription and translation levels of all yeast genes. While negligible relative changes were observed in steady-state mRNA levels, a significant number of mRNAs appeared to have altered ribosomal density. Notably, 40{\%} of the genes having reliable signals changed their ribosomal association by more than one ribosome. Yet, no general correlations with physical or functional features of the mRNA were observed. Ribosome Density Mapping (RDM) along four of the mRNAs with increased association revealed an increase in ribosomal density towards the end of the coding region for at least two of them. Read-through analysis did not reveal any increase in read-through of a premature stop codon by the mutant strain.

CONCLUSION: The ribosomal protein rpS9 appears to be involved in the translation of many mRNAs, since altering its C terminus led to a significant change in ribosomal association of many mRNAs. We did not find strong correlations between these changes and several physical features of the mRNA, yet future studies with advanced tools may allow such correlations to be determined. Importantly, our results indicate an accumulation of ribosomes towards the end of the coding regions of some mRNAs. This suggests an involvement of S9 in ribosomal dissociation during translation termination.},

For example, ribosomal protein (RP) genes are tightly coexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the cis and trans factors associated with them are surprisingly diverged across Ascomycota fungi. Little is known, however, about the functional impact of such changes on actual expression levels or about the selective pressures that affect them. Here, we address this question in the context of the evolution of the regulation of RP gene expression by using a comparative genomics approach together with cross-species functional assays. We show that an activator (Ifh1) and a repressor (Crf1) that control RP gene regulation in normal and stress conditions in S. cerevisiae are derived from the duplication and subsequent specialization of a single ancestral protein. We provide evidence that this regulatory innovation coincides with the duplication of RP genes in a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event and may have been important for tighter control of higher levels of RP transcripts. We find that subsequent loss of the derived repressor led to the loss of a stress-dependent repression of RPs in the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. Our comparative computational and experimental approach shows how gene duplication can constrain and drive regulatory evolution and provides a general strategy for reconstructing the evolutionary trajectory of gene regulation across species.},
annote = {2012{\_}Wapinski et al{\_}Gene duplication and rp gene regulation{\#}background
The system changed several times since the last common ancestor of ascomycota
Chabges: loss of Tbf1 (ancestral regulator), emergence of Rap1 as a regulator among the Hemiascomycota, addition of Mcm1 as a regulator in Kluyveromyces lactis. 
Unclear whether it affected gene expression.
In C. albicans RP genes do not respond to environmental stress like that in cerevisiae.
All curcuits characterized to date have some constituite elements (Tbf1 in C. alb. and Rap1 in cer.) and some regulated by nutrient- and env response pathways (Ifh1, Sfp1). 

        

        
{\#}results 
Crf1 and Ifh1 are homologs. (Shown earlier) 
{\#}picturnknown whether crf1-deletion phenotype is derived or ancestral. 
Compared sequences
Pre-WGD ortholos are similar to Ifh1.
Crf1 and all its post-WGD orthologs lack an ancestral acidic N-terminal domain + 4.5x elevated substitution rate in Crf compared to Ifh. 
In most post-WGD Crf1 orthologs are present. In C. glabrata, they are lost. It also has only 4 or 5{\%} of duplicated RP genes (compared to 55 or 69 in others). 
So, hypothesis: the role of Crf1 emerged after WGD but before the divergence between Scer and Scas. 
Expression profiling in response to stress (for Cgla they tested both 37 and 42 because it{\&}{\#}039;s adapted to 37). Cgla doesn{\&}{\#}039;t respond to stress whether Scer and Scas do. Both S species repress IFH1 and induce CRF1 under stress. 
Wgat was the trajectory? Neofunctionalization? Subfunctionalization?
To distinguish they measured genome-wide mRNA expression profiles during stress in all 3 species. Calb: observed only at 42 but very robust. Thus, this program predates the WGD and support subfunctionalization model. 
Searched for overrepresented sequences. IFHL sites (bound by Fhl1/Ifh1/Crf1 in Scer) are enriched in promotors of Klac, Kwal, Scas, Cgla. Colocated by RAP1 site. Calb: dominated Tbf1 and Cbf1 and no discernible IFHL sites. why that happens? Either Fhl1 and Ifh1 bind indirectly thru Tbf1 or Fhl1 recognizes a variant site similar to that of Tbf1. 
In all species except for Calb promoters were enriched for RAP1, HomolD, RGE. 
Cgla and Klac: MCM1. 

        

        
+ examined the role of Sfp1. !!! Site similar to RGE.
RGE is enriched in RPG promoters in ALL species including Cgla. It mights be an explanation of repression after glc depletion.

        

        
{\#}discussion
Cgla does repress RiBi genes uner stress.

abstract = {In many high complexity systems (cells, organisms, institutions, societies, economies, etc.), it is unclear which components should be regulated to affect overall performance. To identify and prioritize molecular targets which impact cellular phenotypes, we have developed a selection procedure ("SPI"-single promoting/inhibiting target identification) which monitors the abundance of ectopic cDNAs. We have used this approach to identify growth regulators. For this purpose, complex pools of S. cerevisiae cDNA transformants were established and we quantitated the evolution of the spectrum of cDNAs which was initially present. These data emphasized the importance of translation initiation and ER-Golgi traffic for growth. SPI provides functional insight into the stability of cellular phenotypes under circumstances in which established genetic approaches cannot be implemented. It provides a functional "synthetic genetic signature" for each state of the cell (i.e. genotype and environment) by surveying complex genetic libraries, and does not require specialized arrays of cDNAs/shRNAs, deletion strains, direct assessment of clonal growth or even a conditional phenotype. Moreover, it establishes a hierarchy of importance of those targets which can contribute, either positively or negatively, to modify the prevailing phenotype. Extensions of these proof-of-principle experiments to other cell types should provide a novel and powerful approach to analyze multiple aspects of the basic biology of yeast and animal cells as well as clinically-relevant issues.},

abstract = {Initiation of translation is the process by which initiator tRNA and the start codon of mRNA are positioned in the ribosomal P site. In eukaryotes, one of the first steps involves the binding of two small factors, eIF1 and eIF1A, to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit. This facilitates tRNA binding, allows scanning of mRNA, and maintains fidelity of start codon recognition. Using cryo-EM, we have obtained 3D reconstructions of 40S bound to both eIF1 and eIF1A, and with each factor alone. These structures reveal that together, eIF1 and eIF1A stabilize a conformational change that opens the mRNA binding channel. Biochemical data reveal that both factors accelerate the rate of ternary complex (eIF2*GTP*Met-tRNA(i)(Met)) binding to 40S but only eIF1A stabilizes this interaction. Our results suggest that eIF1 and eIF1A promote an open, scanning-competent preinitiation complex that closes upon start codon recognition and eIF1 release to stabilize ternary complex binding and clamp down on mRNA.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, in vivo formation of the two ribosomal subunits from four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and approximately 80 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) involves more than 150 nonribosomal proteins and around 100 small noncoding RNAs. It is temporally and spatially organized within different cellular compartments: the nucleolus, the nucleoplasm, and the cytoplasm. Here, we present a way to analyze how eukaryotic r-proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) assemble in vivo with rRNA. Our results show that key aspects of the assembly of eukaryotic r-proteins into distinct structural parts of the SSU are similar to the in vitro assembly pathway of their prokaryotic counterparts. We observe that the establishment of a stable assembly intermediate of the eukaryotic SSU body, but not of the SSU head, is closely linked to early rRNA processing events. The formation of assembly intermediates of the head controls efficient nuclear export of the SSU and cytoplasmic pre-rRNA maturation steps.},

abstract = {Translation initiation factor 1A stimulates 40S-binding of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)/GTP/Met-tRNA(iMet) ternary complex (TC) and promotes scanning in vitro. eIF1A contains an OB-fold present in bacterial IF1 plus N- and C-terminal extensions. Truncating the C-terminus (deltaC) or mutating OB-fold residues (66-70) of eIF1A reduced general translation in vivo but increased GCN4 translation (Gcd- phenotype) in a manner suppressed by overexpressing TC. Consistent with this, both mutations diminished 40S-bound TC, eIF5 and eIF3 in vivo, and deltaC impaired TC recruitment in vitro. The assembly defects of the OB-fold mutation can be attributed to reduced 40S-binding of eIF1A, whereas deltaC impairs eIF1A function on the ribosome. A substitution in the C-terminal helix (98-101) also reduced 43S assembly in vivo. Rather than producing a Gcd- phenotype, however, 98-101 impairs GCN4 derepression in a manner consistent with defective scanning by reinitiating ribosomes. Indeed, 98-101 allows formation of aberrant 48S complexes in vitro and increases utilization of non-AUG codons in vivo. Thus, the OB-fold is crucial for ribosome-binding and the C-terminal domain of eIF1A has eukaryotic-specific functions in TC recruitment and scanning.},

abstract = {A comprehensive investigation of ribosomal genes in complete genomes from 66 different species allows us to address the distribution of r-proteins between and within the three primary domains. Thirty-four r-protein families are represented in all domains but 33 families are specific to Archaea and Eucarya, providing evidence for specialisation at an early stage of evolution between the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to Archaea and Eukaryotes. With only one specific r-protein, the archaeal ribosome appears to be a small-scale model of the eukaryotic one in terms of protein composition. However, the mechanism of evolution of the protein component of the ribosome appears dramatically different in Archaea. In Bacteria and Eucarya, a restricted number of ribosomal genes can be lost with a bias toward losses in intracellular pathogens. In Archaea, losses implicate 15{\%} of the ribosomal genes revealing an unexpected plasticity of the translation apparatus and the pattern of gene losses indicates a progressive elimination of ribosomal genes in the course of archaeal evolution. This first documented case of reductive evolution at the domain scale provides a new framework for discussing the shape of the universal tree of life and the selective forces directing the evolution of prokaryotes.},

abstract = {Two previously undetected domains were identified in a variety of RNA-binding proteins, particularly RNA-modifying enzymes, using methods for sequence profile analysis. A small domain consisting of 60-65 amino acid residues was detected in the ribosomal protein S4, two families of pseudouridine synthases, a novel family of predicted RNA methylases, a yeast protein containing a pseudouridine synthetase and a deaminase domain, bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, and a number of uncharacterized, small proteins that may be involved in translation regulation. Another novel domain, designated PUA domain, after PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase, was detected in archaeal and eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases, archaeal archaeosine synthases, a family of predicted ATPases that may be involved in RNA modification, a family of predicted archaeal and bacterial rRNA methylases. Additionally, the PUA domain was detected in a family of eukaryotic proteins that also contain a domain homologous to the translation initiation factor eIF1/SUI1; these proteins may comprise a novel type of translation factors. Unexpectedly, the PUA domain was detected also in bacterial and yeast glutamate kinases; this is compatible with the demonstrated role of these enzymes in the regulation of the expression of other genes. We propose that the S4 domain and the PUA domain bind RNA molecules with complex folded structures, adding to the growing collection of nucleic acid-binding domains associated with DNA and RNA modification enzymes.

Both yeast and hyphal cells have properties well suited to tissue invasion and evasion of the immune system. However, molecular control circuits that regulate morphogenesis also regulate the expression of other virulence traits. To establish the extent to which morphogenesis impacts on pathogenesis, it is necessary to characterise the morphology of the fungus at different stages and locations during the natural history of a disease and to untangle how gene expression is modulated at these stages. This review considers the role of morphogenesis in fungal infection and argues that no simple, universal relationship can be drawn between morphology and the invasive potential of a fungus.},

The potential of individual yeast cells to switch between different growth modes is advantageous for optimal dissemination, protection and substrate colonization at the population level. A crucial step in lifestyle adaptation is the control of self- and foreign adhesion. For this purpose, S. cerevisiae contains a set of cell wall-associated proteins, which confer adhesion to diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces. Here, we provide an overview of different aspects of S. cerevisiae adhesion, including a detailed description of known lifestyles, recent insights into adhesin structure and function and an outline of the complex regulatory network for adhesin gene regulation. Our review shows that S. cerevisiae is a model system suitable for studying not only the mechanisms and regulation of cell adhesion, but also the role of this process in microbial development, ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Microbial populations in nature often form organized multicellular structures (biofilms, colonies) occupying different surfaces including host tissues and medical devices. How yeast cells within such populations cooperate and how their dimorphic switch to filamentous growth is regulated are therefore important questions. Studying population development, we discovered that Saccharomyces cerevisiae microcolonies early after their origination from one cell successfully occupy the territory via dimorphic transition, which is induced by ammonia and other volatile amines independently on cell ploidy and nutrients. It results in oriented pseudohyphal cell expansion in the direction of ammonia source, which consequently leads to unification of adjacent microcolonies to one more numerous entity. The further population development is accompanied by another dimorphic switch, which is strictly dependent on Flo11p adhesin and is indispensable for proper formation of biofilm-like aerial 3-D colony architecture. In this, Flo11p is required for both elongation of cells organized to radial clusters (formed earlier within the colony) and their subsequent pseudohyphal expansion. Just before this expansion, Flo11p relocalizes from the bud-neck of radial cell clusters also to the tip of elongated cells.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes a Flo (flocculin) adhesin family responsible for cell-cell and cell-surface adherence. In commonly used laboratory strains, these FLO genes are transcriptionally silent, because of a nonsense mutation in the transcriptional activator FLO8, concealing the potential phenotypic diversity of fungal adhesion. Here, we analyse the distinct adhesion characteristics conferred by each of the five FLO genes in the S288C strain and compare these phenotypes with a strain containing a functional copy of FLO8. Our results show that four FLO genes confer flocculation, but with divergent characteristics such as binding strength, carbohydrate recognition and floc size. Adhesion to agar surfaces, on the other hand, largely depended on two adhesins, Flo10 and Flo11. Expression of any FLO gene caused a significant increase in cell wall hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, the capacity to adhere to plastic surfaces, which is believed to depend on hydrophobic interactions, differed strongly between the adhesins. Restoring Flo8 yielded both flocculation and cell-surface adherence, such as invasive growth, a phenotype not observed when any of the single FLO genes was overexpressed. Taken together, this study reveals how S. cerevisiae carries a small reservoir of FLO genes that allows cells to display a wide variety of adhesive properties.},

abstract = {Many fungal species including pathogens exhibit filamentous growth (FG) as a means of foraging for nutrients. Genetic screens were performed to identify genes required for FG in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genes encoding proteins with established functions in transcriptional activation (MCM1, MATalpha2, PHD1, MSN2, SIR4, and HMS2), cell wall integrity (MPT5, WSC2, and MID2), and cell polarity (BUD5) were identified as potential regulators of FG. The transcription factors MCM1 and MATalpha2 induced invasive growth by promoting diploid-specific bipolar budding in haploid cells. Components of the cell wall integrity pathway including the cell surface proteins Slg1p/Wsc1p, Wsc2p, Mid2p, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Slt2p/Mpk1p contributed to multiple aspects of the FG response including cell elongation, cell-cell adherence, and agar invasion. Mid2p and Wsc2p stimulated the FG MAPK pathway through the signaling mucin Msb2p and components of the MAPK cascade. The FG pathway contributed to cell wall integrity in parallel with the cell wall integrity pathway and in opposition with the high osmolarity glycerol response pathway. Mass spectrometry approaches identified components of the filamentous cell wall including the mucin-like proteins Msb2p, Flo11p, and subtelomeric (silenced) mucin Flo10p. Secretion of Msb2p, which occurs as part of the maturation of the protein, was inhibited by the ss-1,3-glucan layer of the cell wall, which highlights a new regulatory aspect to cell wall remodeling in this organism. Disruption of ss-1,3-glucan linkages induced mucin shedding and resulted in defects in cell-cell adhesion and invasion of cells into the agar matrix.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mating, filamentous growth (FG), and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways share components and yet mediate distinct responses to different extracellular signals. Cross talk is suppressed between the mating and FG pathways because mating signaling induces the destruction of the FG transcription factor Tec1. We show here that HOG pathway activation results in phosphorylation of the FG MAPK, Kss1, and the MAPKK, Ste7. However, FG transcription is not activated because HOG signaling prevents the activation of Tec1. In contrast to the mating pathway, we find that the mechanism involves the inhibition of DNA binding by Tec1 rather than its destruction. We also find that nuclear accumulation of Tec1 is not affected by HOG signaling. Inhibition by Hog1 is apparently indirect since it does not require any of the consensus S/TP MAPK phosphorylation sites on Tec1, its DNA-binding partner Ste12, or the associated regulators Dig1 or Dig2. It also does not require the consensus MAPK sites of the Ste11 activator Ste50, in contrast to a recent proposal for a role for negative feedback in specificity. Our results demonstrate that HOG signaling interrupts the FG pathway signal transduction between the phosphorylation of Kss1 and the activation of DNA binding by Tec1.},

abstract = {The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responds to various environmental cues by invoking specific adaptive mechanisms for their survival. Under nitrogen limitation, S. cerevisiae undergoes a dimorphic filamentous transition called pseudohyphae, which helps the cell to forage for nutrients and reach an environment conducive for growth. This transition is governed by a complex network of signaling pathways, namely cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR, which controls the transcriptional activation of FLO11, a flocculin gene that encodes a cell wall protein. However, little is known about how these pathways co-ordinate to govern the conversion of nutritional availability into gene expression. Here, we have analyzed an integrative network comprised of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways with respect to the availability of nitrogen source using experimental and steady state modeling approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the steady state expression of FLO11 was bistable over a range of inducing ammonium sulphate concentration based on the preculturing condition. We also show that yeast switched from FLO11 expression to accumulation of trehalose, a STRE response controlled by a transcriptional activator Msn2/4, with decrease in the inducing concentration to complete starvation. Steady state analysis of the integrative network revealed the relationship between the environment, signaling cascades and the expression of FLO11. We demonstrate that the double negative feedback loop in TOR pathway can elicit a bistable response, to differentiate between vegetative growth, filamentous growth and STRE response. Negative feedback on TOR pathway function to restrict the expression of FLO11 under nitrogen starved condition and also with re-addition of nitrogen to starved cells. In general, we show that these global signaling pathways respond with specific sensitivity to regulate the expression of FLO11 under nitrogen limitation. The holistic steady state modeling approach of the integrative network revealed how the global signaling pathways could differentiate between multiple phenotypes.},

abstract = {The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has emerged as an archetype of eukaryotic cell biology. Here we show that S. cerevisiae is also a model for the evolution of cooperative behavior by revisiting flocculation, a self-adherence phenotype lacking in most laboratory strains. Expression of the gene FLO1 in the laboratory strain S288C restores flocculation, an altered physiological state, reminiscent of bacterial biofilms. Flocculation protects the FLO1 expressing cells from multiple stresses, including antimicrobials and ethanol. Furthermore, FLO1(+) cells avoid exploitation by nonexpressing flo1 cells by self/non-self recognition: FLO1(+) cells preferentially stick to one another, regardless of genetic relatedness across the rest of the genome. Flocculation, therefore, is driven by one of a few known "green beard genes," which direct cooperation toward other carriers of the same gene. Moreover, FLO1 is highly variable among strains both in expression and in sequence, suggesting that flocculation in S. cerevisiae is a dynamic, rapidly evolving social trait.},

abstract = {Establishment of cell polarity is important for a wide range of biological processes, from asymmetric cell growth in budding yeast to neurite formation in neurons. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the small GTPase Cdc42 controls polarized actin organization and exocytosis toward the bud. Gic2, a Cdc42 effector, is targeted to the bud tip and plays an important role in early bud formation. The GTP-bound Cdc42 interacts with Gic2 through the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain located at the N terminus of Gic2 and activates Gic2 during bud emergence. Here we identify a polybasic region in Gic2 adjacent to the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain that directly interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that this interaction is necessary for the polarized localization of Gic2 to the bud tip and is important for the function of Gic2 in cell polarization. We propose that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Cdc42 act in concert to regulate polarized localization and function of Gic2 during polarized cell growth in the budding yeast.},

abstract = {In many industrial fermentation processes, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast should ideally meet two partially conflicting demands. During fermentation, a high suspended yeast count is required to maintain a satisfactory rate of fermentation, while at completion, efficient settling is desired to enhance product clarification and recovery. In most fermentation industries, currently used starter cultures do not satisfy this ideal, probably because nonflocculent yeast strains were selected to avoid fermentation problems. In this paper, we assess molecular strategies to optimize the flocculation behavior of S. cerevisiae. For this purpose, the chromosomal copies of three dominant flocculation genes, FLO1, FLO5, and FLO11, of the haploid nonflocculent, noninvasive, and non-flor-forming S. cerevisiae FY23 strain were placed under the transcriptional control of the promoters of the ADH2 and HSP30 genes. All six promoter-gene combinations resulted in specific flocculation behaviors in terms of timing and intensity. The strategy resulted in stable expression patterns providing a platform for the direct comparison and assessment of the specific impact of the expression of individual dominant FLO genes with regard to cell wall characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, and substrate adhesion properties. The data also clearly demonstrate that the flocculation behavior of yeast strains can be tightly controlled and fine-tuned to satisfy specific industrial requirements.},

abstract = {Flor yeasts are a particular kind of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains involved in Sherry wine biological ageing. During this process, yeasts form a film on the wine surface and use ethanol as a carbon source, producing acetaldehyde as a by-product. Acetaldehyde induces BTN2 transcription in laboratory strains. Btn2p is involved in the control of the subcellular localization of different proteins. The BTN2 gene shows a complex expression pattern in wine yeast, increasing its expression by acetaldehyde, but repressing it by ethanol. A flor yeast strain transcribes more BTN2 than a first fermentation yeast during growth, but less under different stress conditions. BTN2 deletion decreases flor yeast resistance to high ethanol concentrations. Surprisingly, this effect is suppressed by the addition of high amounts of amino acids to the growth medium, indicating that the role of Btn2p protein in amino acid transport is important for ethanol resistance. Btn2p deletion increases the fermentative capacity of flor yeast and its overexpression prevents its growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. BTN2 deletion also affects the biofilm formation ability of flor yeast, and it increases its sliding motility, resulting in increased mat formation. This correlates with an increased transcription of the FLO11 gene, a gene essential for biofilm formation.},

In pathogens such as Candida spp. and other fungi, adhesins are responsible for adherence to mammalian tissues, and in Saccharomyces spp. yeasts also confer adherence to solid surfaces and to other yeast cells. The analysis of FLO11, the main adhesin identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has revealed complex mechanisms, involving both genetic and epigenetic regulation, governing the expression of this critical gene. We designed a genomewide screen to identify new regulators of this pivotal adhesin in budding yeasts. We took advantage of a specific FLO11 allele that confers very high levels of FLO11 expression to wild "flor" strains of S. cerevisiae. We screened for mutants that abrogated the increased FLO11 expression of this allele using the loss of the characteristic fluffy-colony phenotype and a reporter plasmid containing GFP controlled by the same FLO11 promoter. Using this approach, we isolated several genes whose function was essential to maintain the expression of FLO11. In addition to previously characterized activators, we identified a number of novel FLO11 activators, which reveal the pH response pathway and chromatin-remodeling complexes as central elements involved in FLO11 activation.},

abstract = {Summary: The establishment of cell polarity is critical for the development of many organisms and for the function of many cell types. A large number of studies of diverse organisms from yeast to humans indicate that the conserved, small-molecular-weight GTPases function as key signaling proteins involved in cell polarization. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a particularly attractive model because it displays pronounced cell polarity in response to intracellular and extracellular cues. Cells of S. cerevisiae undergo polarized growth during various phases of their life cycle, such as during vegetative growth, mating between haploid cells of opposite mating types, and filamentous growth upon deprivation of nutrition such as nitrogen. Substantial progress has been made in deciphering the molecular basis of cell polarity in budding yeast. In particular, it becomes increasingly clear how small GTPases regulate polarized cytoskeletal organization, cell wall assembly, and exocytosis at the molecular level and how these GTPases are regulated. In this review, we discuss the key signaling pathways that regulate cell polarization during the mitotic cell cycle and during mating.},

abstract = {Over the last 15 years, yeast pseudohyphal growth (PHG) has been the focus of intense research interest as a model of fungal pathogenicity. Specifically, PHG is a stress response wherein yeast cells deprived of nitrogen form filaments of elongated cells. Nitrogen limitation also induces autophagy, a ubiquitous eukaryotic stress response in which proteins are trafficked to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation and recycling. Although autophagy and filamentous growth are both responsive to nitrogen stress, a link between these processes has not been investigated to date. Here, we present several studies describing an interrelationship between autophagy and filamentous growth. By microarray-based expression profiling, we detect extensive upregulation of the pathway governing autophagy during early PHG and find both processes active under conditions of nitrogen stress in a filamentous strain of budding yeast. Inhibition of autophagy results in increased PHG, and autophagy-deficient yeast induce PHG at higher concentrations of available nitrogen. Our results suggest a model in which autophagy mitigates nutrient stress, delaying the onset of PHG; conversely, inhibition of autophagy exacerbates nitrogen stress, resulting in precocious and overactive PHG. This physiological connection highlights the central role of autophagy in regulating the cell's nutritional state and the responsiveness of PHG to that state.},

abstract = {We compared the transcriptomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing under steady-state conditions on 21 unique sources of nitrogen. We found 506 genes differentially regulated by nitrogen and estimated the activation degrees of all identified nitrogen-responding transcriptional controls according to the nitrogen source. One main group of nitrogenous compounds supports fast growth and a highly active nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) control. Catabolism of these compounds typically yields carbon derivatives directly assimilable by a cell's metabolism. Another group of nitrogen compounds supports slower growth, is associated with excretion by cells of nonmetabolizable carbon compounds such as fusel oils, and is characterized by activation of the general control of amino acid biosynthesis (GAAC). Furthermore, NCR and GAAC appear interlinked, since expression of the GCN4 gene encoding the transcription factor that mediates GAAC is subject to NCR. We also observed that several transcriptional-regulation systems are active under a wider range of nitrogen supply conditions than anticipated. Other transcriptional-regulation systems acting on genes not involved in nitrogen metabolism, e.g., the pleiotropic-drug resistance and the unfolded-protein response systems, also respond to nitrogen. We have completed the lists of target genes of several nitrogen-sensitive regulons and have used sequence comparison tools to propose functions for about 20 orphan genes. Similar studies conducted for other nutrients should provide a more complete view of alternative metabolic pathways in yeast and contribute to the attribution of functions to many other orphan genes.},

abstract = {A transcriptome analysis was performed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoing isoamyl alcohol-induced filament formation. In the crucial first 5 h of this process, only four mRNA species displayed strong and statistically significant increases in their levels of more than 10-fold. Two of these (YEL071w/DLD3 and YOL151w/GRE2) appear to play important roles in filamentation. The biochemical activities ascribed to these two genes (d-lactate dehydrogenase and methylglyoxal reductase, respectively) displayed similarly timed increases to those of their respective mRNAs. Mutants carrying dld3 mutations displayed reduced filamentation in 0.5{\%} isoamyl alcohol and needed a higher concentration of isoamyl alcohol to effect more complete filament formation. Hence, DLD3 seems to be required for a full response to isoamyl alcohol, but is not absolutely essential for it. Mutants carrying gre2 mutations were derepressed for filament formation and formed large, invasive filaments even in the absence of isoamyl alcohol. These results indicate a previously unsuspected and novel role for the GRE2 gene product as a suppressor of filamentation by virtue of encoding isovaleraldehyde reductase activity.},

Here we show that seven yeast genes required for invasive growth, a developmental pathway induced by nutrient limitation, contain potent IRESs that require the initiation factor eIF4G for cap-independent translation. In contrast to the RNA structure-based activity of viral IRESs, we show that an unstructured A-rich element mediates internal initiation via recruitment of the poly(A) binding protein (Pab1) to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of invasive growth messages. A 5'UTR mutation that impairs IRES activity compromises invasive growth, which indicates that cap-independent translation is required for physiological adaptation to stress.},

abstract = {Various starvation conditions cause adhesive growth of haploid cells or pseudohyphae formation of diploid cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For the genetic Sigma1278b background, these morphological changes depend on the expression of the gene encoding the cell wall glycoprotein Flo11p, which is increased during nutritional limitations. Deletion of the genes encoding the transcriptional coactivators Rsc1p or Gcn5p impairs FLO11 transcription, which consequently leads to a loss of both haploid invasive growth and diploid pseudohyphae development upon glucose and nitrogen limitation, respectively. In contrast, amino acid starvation induces FLO11-dependent adhesive growth of the rsc1Delta and gcn5Delta strains although FLO11 transcription remains very low. The double deletion strain rsc1Deltaflo11Delta, however, does not grow adhesively, suggesting that the adhesion of the rsc1Delta strain at amino acid starvation is still FLO11-dependent. The FLO11prom-lacZ-encoded beta-galactosidase activities of the rsc1Delta and gcn5Delta mutant strains increase manifold upon amino acid starvation. It is therefore concluded that low levels of FLO11 transcripts are essential and sufficient for derepression of FLO11 expression and adhesive growth during amino acid starvation. A posttranscriptional control is assumed to be behind this phenomenon that permits the increased FLO11 expression from low FLO11 transcript abundances.},

The commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strain S288c carries a flo8 mutation, and is only able to express the flocculin-encoding genes FLO1 and FLO11, when FLO8 is restored. We show here that the two flocculin genes exhibit differences in regulation to execute distinct functions under various environmental conditions. In contrast to the laboratory strain Sigma1278b, haploids of the S288c genetic background require FLO1 for cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, whereas FLO11 is required for pseudohyphae formation of diploids. In contrast to FLO11, FLO1 repression requires the Sin4p mediator tail component, but is independent of the repressor Sfl1p. FLO1 regulation also differs from FLO11, because it requires neither the KSS1 MAP kinase cascade nor the pathways which lead to the transcription factors Gcn4p or Msn1p. The protein kinase A pathway and the transcription factors Flo8p and Mss11p are the major regulators for FLO1 expression. Therefore, S. cerevisiae is prepared to simultaneously express two genes of its otherwise silenced FLO reservoir resulting in an appropriate cellular surface for different environments.},

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-cross-linked adhesins have essential roles in mating, colony morphology, host-pathogen interactions, and biofilm formation. We review the structure and binding properties of cell wall-bound adhesins of ascomycetous yeasts and relate them to their effects on cellular interactions, with particular emphasis on the agglutinins and flocculins of Saccharomyces and the Als proteins of Candida. These glycoproteins share common structural motifs tailored to surface activity and biological function. After being secreted to the outer face of the plasma membrane, they are covalently anchored in the wall through modified GPI anchors, with their binding domains elevated beyond the wall surface on highly glycosylated extended stalks. N-terminal globular domains bind peptide or sugar ligands, with between millimolar and nanomolar affinities. These affinities and the high density of adhesins and ligands at the cell surface determine microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of cell-cell associations. Central domains often include Thr-rich tandemly repeated sequences that are highly glycosylated. These domains potentiate cell-to-cell binding, but the molecular mechanism of such an association is not yet clear. These repeats also mediate recombination between repeats and between genes. The high levels of recombination and epigenetic regulation are sources of variation which enable the population to continually exploit new niches and resources.},

abstract = {The Flo11/Muc1 flocculin has diverse phenotypic effects. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells of strain background Sigma1278b require Flo11p to form pseudohyphae, invade agar, adhere to plastic, and develop biofilms, but they do not flocculate. We show that S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus strains, on the other hand, exhibit Flo11-dependent flocculation and biofilm formation but do not invade agar or form pseudohyphae. In order to study the nature of the Flo11p proteins produced by these two types of strains, we examined secreted Flo11p, encoded by a plasmid-borne gene, in which the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor sequences had been replaced by a histidine tag. A protein of approximately 196 kDa was secreted from both strains, which upon purification and concentration, aggregated into a form with a very high molecular mass. When secreted Flo11p was covalently attached to microscopic beads, it conferred the ability to specifically bind to S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus cells, which flocculate, but not to Sigma1278b cells, which do not flocculate. This was true for the 196-kDa form as well as the high-molecular-weight form of Flo11p, regardless of the strain source. The coated beads bound to S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus cells expressing FLO11 and failed to bind to cells with a deletion of FLO11, demonstrating a homotypic adhesive mechanism. Flo11p was shown to be a mannoprotein. Bead-to-cell adhesion was inhibited by mannose, which also inhibits Flo11-dependent flocculation in vivo, further suggesting that this in vitro system is a useful model for the study of fungal adhesion.},

abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for fungal biofilm formation due to its ability to adhere to plastic surfaces and to form mats on low-density agar petri plates. Mats are complex multicellular structures composed of a network of cables that form a central hub from which emanate multiple radial spokes. This reproducible and elaborate pattern is indicative of a highly regulated developmental program that depends on specific transcriptional programming, environmental cues, and possibly cell-cell communication systems. While biofilm formation and sliding motility were shown to be strictly dependent on the cell-surface adhesin Flo11p, little is known about the cellular machinery that controls mat formation. Here we show that Hsp70 molecular chaperones play key roles in this process with the assistance of the nucleotide exchange factors Fes1p and Sse1p and the Hsp40 family member Ydj1p. The disruption of these cofactors completely abolished mat formation. Furthermore, complex interactions among SSA genes were observed: mat formation depended mostly on SSA1 while minor defects were observed upon loss of SSA2; additional mutations in SSA3 or SSA4 further enhanced these phenotypes. Importantly, these mutations did not compromise invasive growth or Flo11p expression, suggesting that Flo11p-independent pathways are necessary to form mats.},

abstract = {The RPS26A and RPS26B isogenes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode two almost identical proteins of the small 40S ribosomal subunit, which differ by only two amino acid residues. Growth of an rps26BDelta mutant strain is normal, whereas an rps26ADelta strain displays a reduced growth rate and increased sensitivity towards the specific translational inhibitor paromomycin. An rps26ADelta rps26BDelta double mutant strain is inviable. RPS26A but not RPS26B is required for haploid adhesive and diploid pseudohyphal growth mediated by FLO11, which encodes an adhesion. The RPS26A and RPS26B transcripts make up about 70 and 30{\%} of the cellular RPS26 mRNA, respectively. Overexpression of RPS26B, as well as an RPS26B open reading frame driven by the RPS26A promoter, complements the rps26ADelta deletion and restores haploid invasive growth as well as diploid pseudohyphal growth. These results suggest that the two proteins are functionally interchangeable. FLO11-lacZ activity is not present in haploid rps26ADelta yeast mutant strains, even though FLO11 mRNA levels are not reduced. This suggests that the amount of Rps26p is critical for accurate translation of the FLO11 mRNA, and therefore for the dimorphic switch of the bakera9s yeast from a single cell yeast to an adhesive filamentous growth form.},

abstract = {The dimorphic transition of yeast to the hyphal form is regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Signaling pathway-responsive transcription factors such as Ste12, Tec1, and Flo8 are known to mediate filamentation-specific transcription. We were interested in investigating the translational regulation of specific mRNAs during the yeast-to-hyphal-form transition. Using polyribosome fractionation and RT-PCR analysis, we identified STE12, GPA2, and CLN1 as translation regulation target genes during filamentous growth. The transcript levels for these genes did not change, but their mRNAs were preferentially associated with polyribosomes during the hyphal transition. The intracellular levels of Ste12, Gpa2, and Cln1 proteins increased under hyphal-growth conditions. The increase in Ste12 protein level was partially blocked by mutations in the CAF20 and DHH1 genes, which encode an eIF4E inhibitor and a decapping activator, respectively. In addition, the caf20 and dhh1 mutations resulted in defects in filamentous growth. The filamentation defects caused by caf20 and dhh1 mutations were suppressed by STE12 overexpression. These results suggest that Caf20 and Dhh1 control yeast filamentation by regulating STE12 translation.},

MAT a/alpha diploids that produce IME4 antisense transcript have diminished sense transcription and fail to initiate meiosis. Haploids that produce the sense transcript have diminished antisense transcription and manifest several diploid phenotypes.

abstract = {Gic1 and Gic2 are two Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain-containing effectors of Cdc42-GTPase that promote polarized cell growth in S. cerevisiae. To identify novel genes that functionally interact with Gic1 and Gic2, we screened for high-copy suppressors of a gic1 gic2 temperature-sensitive strain. We identified two pairs of structurally related genes, SKG6-TOS2 and VHS2-MLF3. These genes have been implicated in polarized cell growth, but their functions have not previously been characterized. We found that overproduction of Skg6 and Tos2 in wild-type cells causes aberrant localization of Cdc3 septin and actin structures as well as defective recruitment of Hof1 and impaired formation of the septum at the mother-bud neck. These data suggest a negative regulatory function for Skg6 and Tos2 in cytokinesis. Consistent with this model, deletion of SKG6 suppresses the growth defects associated with loss of HOF1, a positive regulator of cytokinesis. Our analysis of the second pair of gic1 gic2 suppressors, VHS2 and MLF3, suggests that they regulate polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell growth and function in a pathway distinct from and parallel to GIC1 and GIC2.},

abstract = {The invasive and filamentous growth forms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are adaptations to specific environmental conditions, under particular conditions of limited nutrient availability. Both growth forms are dependent on the expression of the FLO11 gene, which encodes a cell-wall-associated glycoprotein involved in cellular adhesion. A complex regulatory network consisting of signaling pathways and transcription factors has been associated with the regulation of FLO11. Mss11p has been identified as a transcriptional activator of this gene, and here we present an extensive genetic analysis to identify functional relationships between Mss11p and other FLO11 regulators. The data show that Mss11p is absolutely required for the activation of FLO11 by most proteins that have previously been shown to affect FLO11 expression, including the signaling proteins Ras2p, Kss1p, and Tpk2p, the activators Tec1p, Flo8p, and Phd1p, and the repressors Nrg1p, Nrg2p, Sok2p, and Sfl1p. The genetic evidence furthermore suggests that Mss11p activity is not dependent on the presence of any of the above-mentioned factors and that the protein also regulates other genes involved in cellular adhesion phenotypes. Taken together, the data strongly suggest a central role for Mss11p in the regulatory network controlling FLO11 expression, invasive growth, and pseudohyphal differentiation.},

We show that Cdc10 and Cdc12 possess GTPase activity and appropriate mutations in conserved nucleotide-binding residues abrogate GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in vitro. In vivo, mutants unable to bind GTP prevent septin collar formation, whereas mutants that block GTP hydrolysis do not. GTP binding-defective Cdc10 and Cdc12 form soluble heteromeric complexes with other septins both in yeast and in bacteria; yet, unlike wild-type, mutant complexes do not bind GTP and do not assemble into filaments in vitro. Absence of a p21-activated protein kinase (Cla4) perturbs septin collar formation. This defect is greatly exacerbated when combined with GTP binding-defective septins; conversely, the septin collar assembly defect of such mutants is suppressed efficiently by CLA4 overexpression. Cla4 interacts directly with and phosphorylates certain septins in vitro and in vivo. Thus, septin collar formation may correspond to septin filament assembly, and requires both GTP binding and Cla4-mediated phosphorylation of septins.},

abstract = {Fungi must recognize plant-specific signals to initiate subsequent morphogenetic events such as filamentation that lead to infection. Here we show that the plant hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) induces adhesion and filamentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome expression profiling of cells treated with IAA identified Yap1, a fungal specific transcription factor, as a key mediator of this response. Strains lacking YAP1 (yap1-1) are hypersensitive to growth on IAA because they accumulate more IAA than can wild type. Members of a family of transporters the amino acid/auxin:proton symport permeases with homology to AUX1, a putative IAA transporter from plants, are up-regulated in the yap1-1 mutant. Deletion of any one of these transporters makes yap1-1 mutants more resistant to IAA by decreasing its uptake. The permease mutants are defective in IAA perception and filamentation. The ability of a fungus to perceive a plant hormone that causes it to differentiate into an invasive form has important implications for plant-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste50 functions in cell signalling between the activated G protein and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK) Ste11. ScSte50 is an essential component of three MAPK-mediated signalling pathways, which control the mating response, invasive/filamentous growth and osmotolerance (HOG pathway), respectively. ScSte50 signalling may also contribute to cell wall integrity in vegetative cells. The protein contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) and a putative Ras-associated domain (RAD), which are essential for signal transduction. Ste50 and Ste11 interact constitutively via their SAM regions. Ste50 interacts weakly and probably transiently with the pheromone receptor-bound heterotrimeric G protein G(alpha beta gamma), and with the small G proteins Cdc42, Ras1 and Ras2. It is specifically the RAD region of Ste50 that mediates the interactions with Cdc42 and Ras. Homologues of ScSTE50 are also found in other fungi, like S. kluyveri, Hansenula polymorpha, Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa. In this review, the role of Ste50 as an adaptor that links the G protein-associated Cdc42-Ste20 kinase complex to the effector kinase Ste11 and thus modulates signal transduction, especially in the pheromone-response pathway of S. cerevisiae, is discussed.},

abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiates into filamentous invasively growing forms under conditions of nutrient limitation. This response is dependent on the transcription factor Ste12 and on the mating pheromone-response mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, but a mechanism for regulation of Ste12 by nutrient limitation has not been defined. Here we show that Ste12 function in filamentous growth is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Srb10 (also known as Cdk8), which is associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Srb10 inhibits filamentous growth in cells growing in rich medium by phosphorylating Ste12 and decreasing its stability. Under conditions of limiting nitrogen, loss of Srb10 protein and kinase activity occurs, with a corresponding loss of Ste12 phosphorylation. Mutation of the Srb10-dependent phosphorylation sites increases pseudohyphal development but has no effect on the pheromone response of haploid yeast. Srb10 kinase activity is also regulated independently of the mating pheromone-response pathway. This indicates that Srb10 controls Ste12 activity for filamentous growth in response to nitrogen limitation and is consistent with the hypothesis that Srb10 regulates gene-specific activators in response to physiological signals to coordinate gene expression with growth potential.},

abstract = {Isoamyl alcohol (IAA) induces a phenotype that resembles pseudohyphae in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show here that IAA causes the rapid formation of linear chains of anucleate buds, each of which is accompanied by the formation of a septin ring at its neck. This process requires the activity of Swe1 and Slt2 (Mpk1). Cdc28 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 19 in a Swe1-dependent manner, while Slt2 becomes activated by dual tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation. Tyrosine 19 phosphorylation of Cdc28 is not dependent on Slt2. However, the defective response in the slt2Delta mutant is rescued by an mih1Delta mutation. The IAA response still occurs in a cell containing a dominant non-phosphorylatable form of Cdc28, but no longer occurs in an mih1Delta slt2Delta mutant containing this form of Cdc28. These observations show that IAA induces the Swe1-dependent morphogenesis checkpoint and so the resulting pseudohyphal phenotype arises in an entirely different way from the formation of pseudohyphae induced by nitrogen-limited growth.},

Here we discuss the role of the Snf1 kinase in regulating filamentous invasive growth. Haploid invasive growth occurs in response to glucose limitation and requires FLO11, a gene encoding a cell-surface adhesin. Snf1 regulates transcription of FLO11 by antagonizing the function of two repressors, Nrg1 and Nrg2. Snf1 and the Nrg repressors also affect diploid pseudohyphal differentiation, which is a response to nitrogen limitation, suggesting an unexpected signalling role for the Snf1 kinase.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell surface protein, Muc1p, was shown to be critical for invasive growth and pseudohyphal differentiation. The transcription of MUC1 and of the co-regulated STA2 glucoamylase gene is controlled by the interplay of a multitude of regulators, including Ste12p, Tec1p, Flo8p, Msn1p and Mss11p. Genetic analysis suggests that Mss11p plays an essential role in this regulatory process and that it functions at the convergence of at least two signalling cascades, the filamentous growth MAPK cascade and the cAMP-PKA pathway. Despite this central role in the control of filamentous growth and starch metabolism, the exact molecular function of Mss11p is unknown. We subjected Mss11p to a detailed molecular analysis and report here on its role in transcriptional regulation, as well as on the identification of specific domains required to confer transcriptional activation in response to nutritional signals. We show that Mss11p contains two independent transactivation domains, one of which is a highly conserved sequence that is found in several proteins with unidentified function in mammalian and invertebrate organisms. We also identify conserved amino acids that are required for the activation function.},

@article{VanDyk2003,
abstract = {In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transition from a nutrient-rich to a nutrient-limited growth medium typically leads to the implementation of a cellular adaptation program that results in invasive growth and/or the formation of pseudohyphae. Complete depletion of essential nutrients, on the other hand, leads either to entry into a nonbudding, metabolically quiescent state referred to as G0 in haploid strains or to meiosis and sporulation in diploids. Entry into meiosis is repressed by the transcriptional regulator Rme1p, a zinc-finger-containing DNA-binding protein. In this article, we show that Rme1p positively regulates invasive growth and starch metabolism in both haploid and diploid strains by directly modifying the transcription of the FLO11 (also known as MUC1) and STA2 genes, which encode a cell wall-associated protein essential for invasive growth and a starch-degrading glucoamylase, respectively. Genetic evidence suggests that Rme1p functions independently of identified signaling modules that regulate invasive growth and of other transcription factors that regulate FLO11 and that the activation of FLO11 is dependent on the presence of a promoter sequence that shows significant homology to identified Rme1p response elements (RREs). The data suggest that Rme1p functions as a central switch between different cellular differentiation pathways.},

@article{Verstrepen2003,
abstract = {For many industrial applications in which the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used, e.g. beer, wine and alcohol production, appropriate flocculation behaviour is certainly one of the most important characteristics of a good production strain. Yeast flocculation is a very complex process that depends on the expression of specific flocculation genes such as FLO1, FLO5, FLO8 and FLO11. The transcriptional activity of the flocculation genes is influenced by the nutritional status of the yeast cells as well as other stress factors. Flocculation is also controlled by factors that affect cell wall composition or morphology. This implies that, during industrial fermentation processes, flocculation is affected by numerous parameters such as nutrient conditions, dissolved oxygen, pH, fermentation temperature, and yeast handling and storage conditions. Theoretically, rational use of these parameters offers the possibility of gaining control over the flocculation process. However, flocculation is a very strain-specific phenomenon, making it difficult to predict specific responses. In addition, certain genes involved in flocculation are extremely variable, causing frequent changes in the flocculation profile of some strains. Therefore, both a profound knowledge of flocculation theory as well as close monitoring and characterisation of the production strain are essential in order to gain maximal control over flocculation. In this review, the various parameters that influence flocculation in real-scale brewing are critically discussed. However, many of the conclusions will also be useful in various other industrial processes where control over yeast flocculation is desirable.},

abstract = {Early studies identified two bona fide protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-encoding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated PPH21 and PPH22. In addition, three PP2A-related phosphatases, encoded by PPH3, SIT4 and PPG1, have been identified. All share as much as 86{\%} sequence similarity at the amino acid level. This review will focus primarily on Pph21 and Pph22, but some aspects of Sit4 regulation will also be discussed. Whereas a role for PP2A in yeast morphology and cell cycle has been readily recognized, uncovering its function in yeast signal transduction is a more recent breakthrough. Via their interaction with phosphorylated Tap42, PP2A and Sit4 play a pivotal role in target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling. PPH22 overexpression mimics overactive cAMP-PKA (protein kinase A) signalling and PP2A and Sit4 might represent ceramide signalling targets.

abstract = {To remain viable, cells have to coordinate cell growth with cell division. In yeast, this occurs at two control points: the boundaries between G1 and S phases, also known as Start, and between G2 and M phases. Theoretically, coordination can be achieved by independent regulation of growth and division, or by participation of surveillance mechanisms in which cell size feeds back into cell-cycle control. This article discusses recent advances in the identification of sizing mechanisms in budding and in fission yeast, and how these mechanisms integrate with environmental stimuli. A comparison of the G1-S and G2-M size-control modules in the two species reveals a degree of conservation higher than previously thought. This reinforces the notion that internal sizing could be a conserved feature of cell-cycle control throughout eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing on media lacking glucose but containing high concentrations of carbon sources such as fructose, galactose, raffinose, and ethanol exhibit enhanced agar invasion. These carbon sources also promote diploid filamentous growth in response to nitrogen starvation. The enhanced invasive and filamentous growth phenotypes are suppressed by the addition of glucose to the media and require the Snf1 kinase. Mutations in the PGI1 and GND1 genes encoding carbon source utilization enzymes confer enhanced invasive growth that is unaffected by glucose but requires active Snf1. Carbon source does not modulate FLO11 flocculin expression, but enhanced polarized bud site selection is necessary for invasion on certain carbon sources. Interestingly, deletion of SNF1 blocks invasion without affecting bud site selection. Snf1 is also required for formation of spokes and hubs in multicellular mats. To examine glucose repression of invasive growth more broadly, we performed genome-wide microarray expression analysis in wild-type cells growing on glucose and galactose, and snf1 Delta cells on galactose. SNF1 probably mediates glucose repression of multiple genes potentially involved in invasive and filamentous growth. FLO11-independent cell-cell attachment, cell wall integrity, and/or polarized growth are affected by carbon source metabolism. In addition, derepression of cell cycle genes and signalling via the cAMP-PKA pathway appears to depend upon SNF1 activity during growth on galactose.},

Here we present evidence that KEM1 plays a role in filamentous growth. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the filamentation signalling shares multiple components of the MAP kinase cascade (STE7, STE11, and KSS1) and the transcription factor STE12 with mating process. Both haploid invasive growth and diploid pseudohyphal growth were found to be greatly impaired in kem1 mutant strains. KEM1 affected the level of FLO11 transcripts and the expression of the filamentation-associated reporter genes, Ty1-lacZ and FLO11-lacZ. Suppression analysis implies that KEM1 does not affect the RAS/PKA pathway, but that it possibly functions downstream of the MAP kinase pathway during filamentation.},

@article{VanDrogen2002,
abstract = {Scaffold proteins play a major role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. In yeast, the Mpk1p-MAP kinase pathway functions to maintain the integrity of the cytoskeleton and the cell wall. In this module, the MEKK Bck1p functions upstream of the MEKs Mkk1p and Mkk2p, which in turn activate the MAP kinase Mpk1p. Mpk1p regulates several nuclear targets, including the transcription factors Rlm1p and SBF, and the two HMG1-like proteins NHP6A and NHP6B. Here we show that Mpk1p constitutively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and both Mpk1p and Mkk1p localize to sites of polarized growth in a Spa2p-dependent manner. Spa2p belongs to a group of proteins that includes Bni1p, Bud6p, and Pea2p, which are involved in the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton during polarized growth. FRAP analysis shows that Spa2p-GFP is stably anchored at bud tips, whereas Mpk1p binds transiently. Spa2p interacts with Mkk1p and Mpk1p, and membrane bound Spa2p is sufficient to recruit Mkk1p and Mpk1p but not other MAP kinases to the cell cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that Spa2p functions as a scaffold-like protein for the cell wall integrity pathway during polarized growth.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of Cdc42 by its guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24 triggers polarization of the actin cytoskeleton at bud emergence and in response to mating pheromones. The adaptor protein Bem1 localizes to sites of polarized growth where it interacts with Cdc42, Cdc24 and the PAK-like kinase Cla4. We have isolated Bem1 mutants (Bem1-m), which are specifically defective for binding to Cdc24. The mutations map within the conserved PB1 domain, which is necessary and sufficient to interact with the octicos peptide repeat (OPR) motif of Cdc24. Although Bem1-m mutant proteins localize normally, bem1-m cells are unable to maintain Cdc24 at sites of polarized growth. As a consequence, they are defective for apical bud growth and the formation of mating projections. Localization of Bem1 to the incipient bud site requires activated Cdc42, and conversely, expression of Cdc42-GTP is sufficient to accumulate Bem1 at the plasma membrane. Thus, our results suggest that Bem1 functions in a positive feedback loop: local activation of Cdc24 produces Cdc42-GTP, which recruits Bem1. In turn, Bem1 stabilizes Cdc24 at the site of polarization, leading to apical growth.},

When expressed in yeast, the C-terminal region of E1A induced pseudohyphal differentiation, and this was independent of both the MAPK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified an interaction between the C-terminal region of E1A and Yak1p, a yeast dual-specificity serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as a negative regulator of growth. E1A also physically interacts with Dyrk1A and Dyrk1B, two mammalian homologs of Yak1p, and stimulates their kinase activity in vitro. We further demonstrate that Yak1p is required in yeast to mediate pseudohyphal differentiation induced by Ras2p-regulated signaling pathways. However, pseudohyphal differentiation induced by the C-terminal region of E1A is largely independent of Yak1p. These data suggest that mammalian Yak1p-related kinases may be targeted by the E1A oncogene to modulate cell growth.},

E1A also physically interacts with Dyrk1A and Dyrk1B, two mammalian homologs of Yak1p, and stimulates their kinase activity in vitro. We further demonstrate that Yak1p is required in yeast to mediate pseudohyphal differentiation induced by Ras2p-regulated signaling pathways. However, pseudohyphal differentiation induced by the C-terminal region of E1A is largely independent of Yak1p. These data suggest that mammalian Yak1p-related kinases may be targeted by the E1A oncogene to modulate cell growth.},

abstract = {In this study we show that inactivation of Hsl1 or Hsl7, negative regulators of the Swe1 kinase, enhances the invasive behavior of haploid and diploid cells. The enhancement of filamentous growth caused by inactivation of both genes is mediated via the Swe1 protein kinase. Whereas Swe1 contributes noticeably to the effectiveness of haploid invasive growth under all conditions tested, its contribution to pseudohyphal growth is limited to the morphological response under standard assay conditions. However, Swe1 is essential for pseudohyphal differentiation under a number of nonstandard assay conditions including altered temperature and increased nitrogen. Swe1 is also required for pseudohyphal growth in the absence of Tec1 and for the induction of filamentation by butanol, a related phenomenon. Although inactivation of Hsl1 is sufficient to suppress the defect in filamentous growth caused by inactivation of Tec1 or Flo8, it is insufficient to promote filamentous growth in the absence of both factors. Moreover, inactivation of Hsl1 will not bypass the requirement for nitrogen starvation or growth on solid medium for pseudohyphal differentiation. We conclude that the Swe1 kinase modulates filamentous development under a broad spectrum of conditions and that its role is partially redundant with the Tec1 and Flo8 transcription factors.},

Supporting the possibility that Ste5 and Ste7 bind to the same region of the MAPKs, they partially competed for Fus3 binding. In vivo, some of the MAPK mutants displayed reduced Ste7-dependent phosphorylation, and all of them exhibited multiple defects in mating and pheromone response. The Kss1 mutants were also defective in Kss1-imposed repression of Ste12. We conclude that MAPKs contain a structurally and functionally conserved docking site that mediates an overall positively acting network of interactions with cognate docking sites on their regulators and substrates.

abstract = {Pseudohyphal growth in both haploid and diploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reflects concerted changes in different cellular processes: budding pattern, cell elongation and cell adhesion. These changes are triggered by environmental signals and are controlled by several pathways which act in parallel. Nitrogen deprivation, and possibly other stresses, activate a MAP kinase cascade which has the transcription factor Ste12 as its final target. A cAMP-dependent pathway, in which the protein kinase Tpk2 plays a specific role, is also required for the morphogenetic switch. Both pathways contribute to modulate the expression of the MUC1/FLO11 gene which encodes a cell-surface flocculin required for pseudohyphal and invasive growth. The MAP kinase cascade could also control the activity of the cyclin/Cdc28 complexes which affect both the budding pattern of yeast and cell elongation. A further protein which stimulates filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae is Phd1; although its mode of action is unknown, it may be regulated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, as occurs with the homologous protein Efg1 from Candida albicans, which is required for the formation of true hyphae. Morphogenesis in different yeast genera share common elements, but there are also important differences. Although a complete picture cannot yet be drawn, partial models may be proposed for the interaction of the regulatory pathways, both in the case of S. cerevisiae and in that of C. albicans.},

abstract = {Haploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae respond to mating pheromones by arresting their cell-division cycle in G1 and differentiating into a cell type capable of locating and fusing with mating partners. Yeast cells undergo chemotactic cell surface growth when pheromones are present above a threshold level for morphogenesis; however, the morphogenetic responses of cells to levels of pheromone below this threshold have not been systematically explored. Here we show that MATa haploid cells exposed to low levels of the alpha-factor mating pheromone undergo a novel cellular response: cells modulate their division patterns and cell shape, forming colonies composed of filamentous chains of cells. Time-lapse analysis of filament formation shows that its dynamics are distinct from that of pseudohyphal growth; during pheromone-induced filament formation, daughter cells are delayed relative to mother cells with respect to the timing of bud emergence. Filament formation requires the RSR1(BUD1), BUD8, SLK1/BCK1, and SPA2 genes and many elements of the STE11/STE7 MAP kinase pathway; this response is also independent of FAR1, a gene involved in orienting cell polarization during the mating response. We suggest that mating yeast cells undergo a complex response to low levels of pheromone that may enhance the ability of cells to search for mating partners through the modification of cell shape and alteration of cell-division patterns.},

We describe the analysis of 12 novel targets, some regulated by Ace2p or Swi5p alone and some by both. We show that Ace2p is the major regulator of four genes (CTS1, YHR143W, SCW11 and YER124C). Expression of all four is inhibited by Swi5p. Like Cts1p and Scw11p, the two new Ace2p targets are associated with cell wall metabolism. Yhr143p is localized to the cell wall, and deletion affects cell separation and enhances pseudohyphal growth. Deleting YER124C also affects cell separation and sensitivity to drugs targeted against the cell wall. Expression of PIR1, YPL158C and YNL046W is dependent on Swi5p alone. In contrast, expression of YBR158W, YNL078W and YOR264W is minimized when both ace2 and swi5 are disrupted. We propose that, although Ace2p and Swi5p co-operate to induce the expression of a subset of genes, some functional divergence has occurred. This results in a delay in the expression of those genes predominantly regulated by Ace2p, compared with those predominantly regulated by Swi5p.},

In yeast cells, the Tor pathway has been implicated in regulating cellular responses to nutrients, including proliferation, translation, transcription, autophagy, and ribosome biogenesis. We report here that rapamycin inhibits pseudohyphal filamentous differentiation of S. cerevisiae in response to nitrogen limitation. Overexpression of Tap42, a protein phosphatase regulatory subunit, restored pseudohyphal growth in cells exposed to rapamycin. The tap42-11 mutation compromised pseudohyphal differentiation and rendered it resistant to rapamycin. Cells lacking the Tap42-regulated protein phosphatase Sit4 exhibited a pseudohyphal growth defect and were markedly hypersensitive to rapamycin. Mutations in other Tap42-regulated phosphatases had no effect on pseudohyphal differentiation. Our findings support a model in which pseudohyphal differentiation is controlled by a nutrient-sensing pathway involving the Tor protein kinases and the Tap42-Sit4 protein phosphatase. Activation of the MAP kinase or cAMP pathways, or mutation of the Sok2 repressor, restored filamentation in rapamycin treated cells, supporting models in which the Tor pathway acts in parallel with these known pathways. Filamentous differentiation of diverse fungi was also blocked by rapamycin, demonstrating that the Tor signaling cascade plays a conserved role in regulating filamentous differentiation in response to nutrients.},

abstract = {The association of G(1) cyclins and Cdc28/cyclin-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the cell cycle entry (Start) in budding yeast. Activation of Start is presumed to be triggered by a post-transcriptional increase in Cln3 during early G(1). Cells arrested by mating pheromone show a loss of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity caused by transcriptional shutoff of cyclins and/or inhibition by Far1. We report that overexpression of eIF4E (Cdc33), a rate-limiting translation initiation factor, causes an increase in CLN3 mRNA translation, which results in increased expression of CLN2 and in slow growth and decreased alpha-factor response. This phenotype was abrogated in a Deltacln3 or Deltacln2 background. We isolated the transcription factor MBP1 as a multicopy suppressor of the growth and alpha-factor response defects. Furthermore, elevated MBP1, a transcriptional regulator of cyclins, altered the transcriptional start site in CLN3 mRNA, shifting it 45 nucleotides upstream of the normal. This lengthened 5'-untranslated region likely reduces translation efficiency and down-regulates CLN3 protein synthesis, thereby correcting for the excess translation promoted by elevated Cdc33. In addition, the CLN2 mRNA level returned to normal. We propose that regulation of translation initiation by Cdc33 plays a pivotal role in the activation of Start and cell cycle progression in budding yeast.},

abstract = {The yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p regulates bud morphogenesis and cell cycle progression via the antagonistic activities of Cln and Clb cyclins. Cln G1 cyclins direct polarized growth and bud emergence, whereas Clb G2 cyclins promote isotropic growth of the bud and chromosome segregation. Using colony morphology as a screen to dissect regulation of polarity by Cdc28p, we identified nine point mutations that block the apical-isotropic switch while maintaining other functions. Like a clb2 Delta mutation, each confers tubular bud shape, apically polarized actin distribution, unipolar budding, and delayed anaphase. The mutations are all suppressed by CLB2 overexpression and are synthetically lethal with a CLB2 deletion. However, defects in multiple independent pathways may underlie their common phenotype, because the mutations are scattered throughout the CDC28 sequence, complement each other, and confer diverse biochemical properties. Glu12Gly, a mutation that alters a residue involved in Swe1p inhibition of Cdc28p, was unique in being suppressed by deficiency of SWE1 or CLN1. With wild-type CDC28, filament formation induced by CLN1 overexpression was markedly decreased in a SWE1 deletion. These results suggest that Swe1p, via inhibition of Clb2p/Cdc28p, may mediate much of the effect of Cln1p on filamentous morphogenesis.},

abstract = {CDC55 encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit. cdc55-null cells growing at low temperature exhibit a failure of cytokinesis and produce abnormally elongated buds, but cdc55-null cells producing the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28-Y19F, which is unable to be inhibited by Y19 phosphorylation, show a loss of the abnormal morphology. Furthermore, cdc55-null cells exhibit a hyperphosphorylation of Y19. For these reasons, we have examined in wild-type and cdc55-null cells the levels and activities of the kinase (Swe1p) and phosphatase (Mih1p) that normally regulate the extent of Cdc28 Y19 phosphorylation. We find that Mih1p levels are comparable in the two strains, and an estimate of the in vivo and in vitro phosphatase activity of this enzyme in the two cell types indicates no marked differences. By contrast, while Swe1p levels are similar in unsynchronized and S-phase-arrested wild-type and cdc55-null cells, Swe1 kinase is found at elevated levels in mitosis-arrested cdc55-null cells. This excess Swe1p in cdc55-null cells is the result of ectopic stabilization of this protein during G(2) and M, thereby accounting for the accumulation of Swe1p in mitosis-arrested cells. We also present evidence indicating that, in cdc55-null cells, misregulated PP2A phosphatase activity is the cause of both the ectopic stabilization of Swe1p and the production of the morphologically abnormal phenotype.},

abstract = {There are about 800 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose transcription is cell-cycle regulated. Some of these form clusters of co-regulated genes. The 'CLB2' cluster contains 33 genes whose transcription peaks early in mitosis, including CLB1, CLB2, SWI5, ACE2, CDC5, CDC20 and other genes important for mitosis. Here we find that the genes in this cluster lose their cell cycle regulation in a mutant that lacks two forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2. Fkh2 protein is associated with the promoters of CLB2, SWI5 and other genes of the cluster. These results indicate that Fkh proteins are transcription factors for the CLB2 cluster. The fkh1 fkh2 mutant also displays aberrant regulation of the 'SIC1' cluster, whose member genes are expressed in the M-G1 interval and are involved in mitotic exit. This aberrant regulation may be due to aberrant expression of the transcription factors Swi5 and Ace2, which are members of the CLB2 cluster and controllers of the SIC1 cluster. Thus, a cascade of transcription factors operates late in the cell cycle. Finally, the fkh1 fkh2 mutant displays a constitutive pseudohyphal morphology, indicating that Fkh1 and Fkh2 may help control the switch to this mode of growth.},

abstract = {Diploid strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae change the pattern of cell division from bipolar to unipolar when switching growth from the unicellular yeast form (YF) to filamentous, pseudohyphal (PH) cells in response to nitrogen starvation. The functions of two transmembrane proteins, Bud8p and Bud9p, in regulating YF and PH cell polarity were investigated. Bud8p is highly concentrated at the distal pole of both YF and PH cells, where it directs initiation of cell division. Asymmetric localization of Bud8p is independent of the Rsr1p/Bud1p GTPase. rsr1/bud1 mutations are epistatic to bud8 mutations, placing Rsr1p/Bud1p downstream of Bud8p. In YF cells, Bud9p is also localized at the distal pole, yet deletion of BUD9 favours distal bud initiation. In PH cells, nutritional starvation for nitrogen efficiently prevents distal localization of Bud9p. Because Bud8p and Bud9p proteins associate in vivo, we propose Bud8p as a landmark for bud initiation at the distal cell pole, where Bud9p acts as inhibitor. In response to nitrogen starvation, asymmetric localization of Bud9p is averted, favouring Bud8p-mediated cell division at the distal pole.},

Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, diploid cells of S. cerevisiae differentiate to a filamentous growth known as a pseudohyphal growth, while haploid cells produce invasive filaments which penetrate the agar in nutrient-rich medium. We have found that GPR1, which encodes a putative G-protein-coupled receptor, is required for both pseudohyphal and invasive growth. Pseudohyphal growth was defective in Deltagpr1/Deltagpr1 mutant strain and this defect was reversed by addition of cAMP. Also, haploid Deltagpr1 mutant strain was defective in invasive growth. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transcriptional level of FLO11, which encodes a recently identified cell surface flocculin required for pseudohyphal growth, was reduced in Deltagpr1 mutant strain. These results indicate that GPR1 regulates both pseudohyphal and invasive growth by a cAMP-dependent mechanism.},

Previous work on signaling cascades that promote agar invasion has demonstrated upregulation of FLO11, a cell-surface flocculin involved in cell-cell adhesion. We find that increasing FLO11 transcription is sufficient to induce both invasive and filamentous growth. A genetic screen for repressors of FLO11 isolated mutant strains that dig into agar (dia) and identified mutations in 35 different genes: ELM1, HSL1, HSL7, BUD3, BUD4, BUD10, AXL1, SIR2, SIR4, BEM2, PGI1, GND1, YDJ1, ARO7, GRR1, CDC53, HSC82, ZUO1, ADH1, CSE2, GCR1, IRA1, MSN5, SRB8, SSN3, SSN8, BPL1, GTR1, MED1, SKN7, TAF25, DIA1, DIA2, DIA3, and DIA4. Indeed, agar invasion in 20 dia mutants requires upregulation of the endogenous FLO11 promoter. However, 13 mutants promote agar invasion even with FLO11 clamped at a constitutive low-expression level. These FLO11 promoter-independent dia mutants establish distinct invasive growth pathways due to polarized bud site selection and/or cell elongation. Epistasis with the STE MAP kinase cascade and cytokinesis/budding checkpoint shows these pathways are targets of DIA genes that repress agar invasion by FLO11 promoter-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively.},

abstract = {Pseudohyphal differentiation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced in diploid cells in response to nitrogen starvation and abundant fermentable carbon source. Filamentous growth requires at least two signaling pathways: the pheromone responsive MAP kinase cascade and the Gpa2p-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Recent studies have established a physical and functional link between the Galpha protein Gpa2 and the G protein-coupled receptor homolog Gpr1. We report here that the Gpr1 receptor is required for filamentous and haploid invasive growth and regulates expression of the cell surface flocculin Flo11. Epistasis analysis supports a model in which the Gpr1 receptor regulates pseudohyphal growth via the Gpa2p-cAMP-PKA pathway and independently of both the MAP kinase cascade and the PKA related kinase Sch9. Genetic and physiological studies indicate that the Gpr1 receptor is activated by glucose and other structurally related sugars. Because expression of the GPR1 gene is known to be induced by nitrogen starvation, the Gpr1 receptor may serve as a dual sensor of abundant carbon source (sugar ligand) and nitrogen starvation. In summary, our studies reveal a novel G protein-coupled receptor senses nutrients and regulates the dimorphic transition to filamentous growth via a Galpha protein-cAMP-PKA signal transduction cascade.},

abstract = {Diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae starved for nitrogen differentiate into a filamentous growth form. Poor carbon sources such as starches can also stimulate filamentation, whereas haploid cells undergo a similar invasive growth response in rich medium. Previous work has demonstrated a role for various alcohols, by-products of amino acid metabolism, in altering cellular morphology. We found that several alcohols, notably isoamyl alcohol and 1-butanol, stimulate filamentous growth in haploid cells in which this differentiation is normally repressed. Butanol also induces cell elongation and changes in budding pattern, leading to a pseudohyphal morphology, even in liquid medium. The filamentous colony morphology and cell elongation require elements of the pheromone-responsive MAPK cascade and TEC1, whereas components of the nutrient-sensing machinery, such as MEP2, GPA2, and GPR1, do not affect this phenomenon. A screen for 1-butanol-insensitive mutants identified additional proteins that regulate polarized growth (BUD8, BEM1, BEM4, and FIG1), mitochondrial function (MSM1, MRP21, and HMI1), and a transcriptional regulator (CHD1). Furthermore, we have also found that ethanol stimulates hyperfilamentation in diploid cells, again in a MAPK-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that yeast may sense a combination of nutrient limitation and metabolic by-products to regulate differentiation.},

abstract = {The SIR1 gene is one of four specialized genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for repressing transcription at the silent mating-type cassettes, HMLalpha and HMRa, by a mechanism known as silencing. Silencing requires the assembly of a specialized chromatin structure analogous to heterochromatin. FKH1 was isolated as a gene that, when expressed in multiple copies, could substitute for the function of SIR1 in silencing HMRa. FKH1 (Forkhead Homologue One) was named for its homology to the forkhead family of eukaryotic transcription factors classified on the basis of a conserved DNA binding domain. Deletion of FKH1 caused a defect in silencing HMRa, indicating that FKH1 has a positive role in silencing. Significantly, deletion of both FKH1 and its closest homologue in yeast, FKH2, caused a form of yeast pseudohyphal growth, indicating that the two genes have redundant functions in controlling yeast cell morphology. By several criteria, fkh1Delta fkh2Delta-induced pseudohyphal growth was distinct from the nutritionally induced form of pseudohyphal growth observed in some strains of S. cerevisiae. Although FKH2 is redundant with FKH1 in controlling pseudohyphal growth, the two genes have different functions in silencing HMRa. High-copy expression of CLB2, a G2/M-phase cyclin, prevented fkh1Delta fkh2Delta-induced pseudohyphal growth and modulated some of the fkhDelta-induced silencing phenotypes. Interestingly, deletions in either FKH1 or FKH2 alone caused subtle but opposite effects on cell-cycle progression and CLB2 mRNA expression, consistent with a role for each of these genes in modulating the cell cycle and having opposing effects on silencing. The differences between Fkh1p and Fkh2p in vivo were not attributable to differences in their DNA binding domains.},

abstract = {The cell wall of bakers' yeast contains a family of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked glycoproteins of domain structure similar to the adhesins of pathogenic fungi. In wild-type cells each of these proteins has a unique function in different developmental processes (mating, invasive growth, cell-cell adhesion, or filamentation). What unifies these developmental events is adhesion, either to an inert substrate or to a cell. Although they differ in their specificities, many of these proteins can substitute for each other when overexpressed. For example, Flo11p is required during vegetative growth for haploid invasion and diploid filamentation, whereas Fig2p is required for mating. When overexpressed, Flo11p and Fig2p can function in mating, invasion, filamentation, and flocculation. The ability of Flo11p to supply Fig2p function in mating depends on its intracellular localization to the mating projection, where Fig2p normally functions in the adhesion of mating cells. Our data show that even distant family members retain the ability to carry out disparate functions if localized and expressed appropriately.},

abstract = {In response to nitrogen limitation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a dimorphic transition to filamentous pseudohyphal growth. In previous studies, the transcription factor Sok2 was found to negatively regulate pseudohyphal differentiation. By genome array and Northern analysis, we found that genes encoding the transcription factors Phd1, Ash1, and Swi5 were all induced in sok2/sok2 hyperfilamentous mutants. In accord with previous studies of others, Swi5 was required for ASH1 expression. Phd1 and Ash1 regulated expression of the cell surface protein Flo11, which is required for filamentous growth, and were largely required for filamentation of sok2/sok2 mutant strains. These findings reveal that a complex transcription factor cascade regulates filamentation. These findings also reveal a novel dual role for the transcription factor Swi5 in regulating filamentous growth. Finally, these studies illustrate how mother-daughter cell adhesion can be accomplished by two distinct mechanisms: one involving Flo11 and the other involving regulation of the endochitinase Cts1 and the endoglucanase Egt2 by Swi5.},

abstract = {We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

abstract = {Haploid yeast invades solid agar in response to nutrient limitation. To decipher the cues that underlie invasion, we have developed a single cell invasive growth assay. Using this assay, as well as the traditional plate-washing assay, we show that invasive growth occurs in response to glucose depletion. In the absence of glucose (or other fermentable sugar), individual cells adopted a nonaxial budding pattern and elongated morphology within the first cell divisions, and invasion into the agar was observed in microcolonies containing as few as 10 cells. In support of this observation, we found that glucose suppressed the hyperinvasive growth morphology of STE11-4, pbs2, hsl7, and RAS2V19 mutations. In addition, removal of glucose from YPD medium caused constitutive invasion in wild-type cells. We tested glucose control proteins for a role in invasion and found that Snf1, a protein required for derepression of glucose-repressed genes, was required for invasive growth. The transcription factor Sip4, which interacts with Snf1 and is induced during the diauxic shift, had an inhibitory role on invasive growth, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are required for glucose depletion-dependent invasion.},

Colony morphology screens were used to identify factors relevant to the process of bipolar budding in yeast. Mutants defective in bipolar budding were identified by virtue of their inability to grow as pseudohyphae in a haploid bud3 background. A mutant allele of the MYO2 gene, encoding a class-V unconventional myosin was identified that perturbs bipolar budding without affecting axial budding and without grossly affecting the role of Myo2p in secretion and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton. Several genes were also identified whose products, when overexpressed, are capable of disrupting bipolar budding. Among these are the actin-monomer-binding protein profilin and the Aip3p/Bud6p-interacting protein Atc1p. The results strongly support involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the establishment of bipolar budding and in the maintenance of pseudohyphal growth.},

abstract = {Expression of an activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) construct in yeast cells was used to examine the conservation of function among mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Sequence alignment of the human MAP kinase ERK1 with all Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinases reveals a particularly strong kinship with Kss1p (invasive growth promoting MAP kinase), Fus3p (pheromone response MAP/ERK kinase), and Mpk1p (cell wall remodeling MAP kinase). A fusion protein of constitutively active human MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK) and human ERK1 was introduced under regulated expression into yeast cells. The fusion protein (MEK/ERK) induced a filamentation response element promoter and led to a growth retardation effect concomitant with a morphological change resulting in elongated cells, bipolar budding, and multicell chains. Induction of filamentous growth was also observed for diploid cells following MEK/ERK expression in liquid culture. Neither haploids nor diploids, however, showed marked penetration of agar medium. These effects could be triggered by either moderate MEK/ERK expression at 37 degrees C or by high level MEK/ERK expression at 30 degrees C. The combination of high level MEK/ERK expression and 37 degrees C resulted in cell death. The deleterious effects of MEK/ERK expression and high temperature were significantly mitigated by 1 m sorbitol, which also enhanced the filamentous phenotype. MEK/ERK was able to constitutively activate a cell wall maintenance reporter gene, suggesting misregulation of this pathway. In contrast, MEK/ERK effectively blocked expression from a pheromone-responsive element promoter and inhibited mating. These results are consistent with MEK/ERK promoting filamentous growth and altering the cell wall through its ability to partially mimic Kss1p and stimulate a pathway normally controlled by Mpk1p, while appearing to inhibit the normal functioning of the structurally related yeast MAP kinase Fus3p.},

abstract = {We have characterized a novel member of the recently identified family of regulators of heterotrimeric G protein signalling (RGS) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The YOR107w/RGS2 gene was isolated as a multi-copy suppressor of glucose-induced loss of heat resistance in stationary phase cells. The N-terminal half of the Rgs2 protein consists of a typical RGS domain. Deletion and overexpression of Rgs2, respectively, enhances and reduces glucose-induced accumulation of cAMP. Overexpression of RGS2 generates phenotypes consistent with low activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), such as enhanced accumulation of trehalose and glycogen, enhanced heat resistance and elevated expression of STRE-controlled genes. Deletion of RGS2 causes opposite phenotypes. We demonstrate that Rgs2 functions as a negative regulator of glucose-induced cAMP signalling through direct GTPase activation of the Gs-alpha protein Gpa2. Rgs2 and Gpa2 constitute the second cognate RGS-G-alpha protein pair identified in yeast, in addition to the mating pheromone pathway regulators Sst2 and Gpa1. Moreover, Rgs2 and Sst2 exert specific, non-overlapping functions, and deletion mutants in Rgs2 and Sst2 are complemented to some extent by different mammalian RGS proteins.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two major signal transduction pathways, the Kss1 MAPK pathway and the cAMP-regulated pathway, are critical for the differentiation of round yeast form cells to multicellular, invasive pseudohyphae. Here we report that these parallel pathways converge on the promoter of a gene, FLO11, which encodes a cell surface protein required for pseudohyphal formation. The FLO11 promoter is unusually large, containing at least four upstream activation sequences (UASs) and nine repression elements which together span at least 2.8 kb. Several lines of evidence indicate that the MAPK and cAMP signals are received by distinct transcription factors and promoter elements. First, regulation via the MAPK pathway requires the transcription factors Ste12p/Tec1p, whereas cAMP-mediated activation requires a distinct factor, Flo8p. Secondly, mutations in either pathway block FLO11 transcription. Overexpression of STE12 can suppress the loss of FLO8, and overexpression of FLO8 can suppress the loss of STE12. Finally, multiple distinct promoter regions of the FLO11 promoter are required for its activation by either Flo8p or Ste12p/ Tec1p. Thus, like the promoters of the key developmental genes, HO and IME1, the FLO11 promoter is large and complex, endowing it with the ability to integrate multiple inputs.},

This signal branch point can be uncoupled in cells expressing Ras2p mutant proteins that carry amino acid substitutions in the adenylyl cyclase interaction domain and therefore activate invasive growth solely dependent on the MAPK cascade. Both Ras2p-controlled signaling pathways stimulate expression of the filamentation response element-driven reporter gene depending on the transcription factors Ste12p and Tec1p, indicating a crosstalk between the MAPK and the cAMP signaling pathways in haploid cells during invasive growth.},

abstract = {In budding yeast, the Clb2 mitotic cyclin initiates a signaling network that negatively regulates polar bud growth during mitosis. This signaling network appears to require the function of a Clb2-binding protein called Nap1, the Cdc42 GTPase, and two protein kinases called Gin4 and Cla4. In this study, we demonstrate that the Elm1 kinase also plays a role in the control of bud growth during mitosis. Cells carrying a deletion of the ELM1 gene undergo a prolonged mitotic delay, fail to negatively regulate polar bud growth during mitosis, and show defects in septin organization. In addition, Elm1 is required in vivo for the proper regulation of both the Cla4 and Gin4 kinases and interacts genetically with Cla4, Gin4, and the mitotic cyclins. Previous studies have suggested that Elm1 may function to negatively regulate the Swe1 kinase. To further understand the functional relationship between Elm1 and Swe1, we have characterized the phenotype of Deltaelm1 Deltaswe1 cells. We found that Deltaelm1 Deltaswe1 cells are inviable at 37 degrees C and that a large proportion of Deltaelm1 Deltaswe1 cells grown at 30 degrees C contain multiple nuclei, suggesting severe defects in cytokinesis. In addition, we found that Elm1 is required for the normal hyperphosphorylation of Swe1 during mitosis. We propose a model in which the Elm1 kinase functions in a mitotic signaling network that controls events required for normal bud growth and cytokinesis, while the Swe1 kinase functions in a checkpoint pathway that delays nuclear division in response to defects in these events.},

abstract = {In response to nitrogen starvation, diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiate to a filamentous growth form known as pseudohyphal differentiation. Filamentous growth is regulated by elements of the pheromone mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and a second signaling cascade involving the receptor Gpr1, the Galpha protein Gpa2, Ras2, and cyclic AMP (cAMP). We show here that the Gpr1-Gpa2-cAMP pathway signals via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase A (PKA), to regulate pseudohyphal differentiation. Activation of PKA by mutation of the regulatory subunit Bcy1 enhances filamentous growth. Mutation and overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunits reveal that the Tpk2 catalytic subunit activates filamentous growth, whereas the Tpk1 and Tpk3 catalytic subunits inhibit filamentous growth. The PKA pathway regulates unipolar budding and agar invasion, whereas the MAP kinase cascade regulates cell elongation and invasion. Epistasis analysis supports a model in which PKA functions downstream of the Gpr1 receptor and the Gpa2 and Ras2 G proteins. Activation of filamentous growth by PKA does not require the transcription factors Ste12 and Tec1 of the MAP kinase cascade, Phd1, or the PKA targets Msn2 and Msn4. PKA signals pseudohyphal growth, in part, by regulating Flo8-dependent expression of the cell surface flocculin Flo11. In summary, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase plays an intimate positive and negative role in regulating filamentous growth, and these findings may provide insight into the roles of PKA in mating, morphogenesis, and virulence in other yeasts and pathogenic fungi.},

abstract = {Cdc42p is an essential GTPase that belongs to the Rho/Rac subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. These proteins act as molecular switches by responding to exogenous and/or endogenous signals and relaying those signals to activate downstream components of a biological pathway. The 11 current members of the Cdc42p family display between 75 and 100{\%} amino acid identity and are functional as well as structural homologs. Cdc42p transduces signals to the actin cytoskeleton to initiate and maintain polarized gorwth and to mitogen-activated protein morphogenesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc42p plays an important role in multiple actin-dependent morphogenetic events such as bud emergence, mating-projection formation, and pseudohyphal growth. In mammalian cells, Cdc42p regulates a variety of actin-dependent events and induces the JNK/SAPK protein kinase cascade, which leads to the activation of transcription factors within the nucleus. Cdc42p mediates these processes through interactions with a myriad of downstream effectors, whose number and regulation we are just starting to understand. In addition, Cdc42p has been implicated in a number of human diseases through interactions with its regulators and downstream effectors. While much is known about Cdc42p structure and functional interactions, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which it transduces signals within the cell. Future research should focus on this question as well as on the detailed analysis of the interactions of Cdc42p with its regulators and downstream effectors.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a network of signal transduction pathways governs the switch from yeast-type growth to pseudohyphal and invasive growth that occurs in response to nutrient limitation. Important elements of this network have been identified, including nutrient signal receptors, GTP-binding proteins, components of the pheromone-dependent MAP kinase cascade and several transcription factors. However, the structural and functional mapping of these pathways is far from complete. Here, we present data regarding three genes, MSN1/MSS10, MSS11 and MUC1/FLO11, which form an essential part of the signal transduction network establishing invasive growth. Both MSN1 and MSS11 are involved in the co-regulation of starch degradation and invasive growth. Msn1p and Mss11p act downstream of Mep2p and Ras2p and regulate the transcription of both STA2 and MUC1. We show that MUC1 mediates the effect of Msn1p and Mss11p on invasive growth. In addition, our results suggest that the activity of Msn1p is independent of the invasive growth MAP kinase cascade, but the Mss11p is required for the activation of pseudohyphal and invasive growth by Ste12p. We also show that starch metabolism in S. cerevisiae is subject to regulation by components of the MAP kinase cascade.},

abstract = {The exocyst is an essential multiprotein complex mediating polarized secretion in yeast. Here we describe a gene, SEM1, that can multicopy-suppress exocyst mutants sec3-2, sec8-9, sec10-2, and sec15-1. SEM1 is highly conserved among eukaryotic species. Its human homologue, DSS1, has been suggested as a candidate gene for the split hand/split foot malformation disorder. SEM1 is not an essential gene. However, its deletion rescued growth of the temperature-sensitive exocyst mutants sec3-2, sec8-9, sec10-1, and sec15-1 at the restrictive temperature. Cell fractionation showed that Sem1p is mainly cytosolic but also associates with the microsomal fraction. In linear sucrose gradients, Sem1p cosedimented with the exocyst component Sec8p. In diploid cells that normally do not form pseudohyphae (S288C background), deletion of SEM1 triggered pseudohyphal growth. This phenotype was abolished after reintroduction of either SEM1 or the mouse homologue Dss1 into the cells. In diploids that have normal capacity for pseudohyphal growth (Sigma1278b background), deletion of SEM1 enhanced filamentous growth. The functionality of both SEM1 and Dss1 in a differentiation process in yeast suggests that Dss1 indeed could be the gene affected in the split hand/split foot malformation disorder. These results characterize SEM1 as a regulator of both exocyst function and pseudohyphal differentiation and suggest a unique link between these two cellular functions in yeast.},

In rich medium, BIR1 mutant S. cerevisiae underwent normal vegetative growth and mitosis. Under starvation conditions, however, BIR1 mutant diploids formed spores inefficiently, instead undergoing pseudohyphal differentiation. Most spores that did form failed to survive beyond two divisions after germination. bir1 mutant S. pombe spores also died in the early divisions after spore germination and became blocked at the metaphase/anaphase transition because of an inability to elongate their mitotic spindle. Rather than inhibiting caspase-mediated cell death, yeast IAP proteins have roles in cell division and appear to act in a similar way to the IAPs from Caenorhabditis elegans and the mammalian IAP Survivin.},

Plc1p binds to Gpr1p in either the presence or absence of Gpa2, whereas the Gpr1p/Gpa2p association depends on the presence of Plc1p. Genetic interactions between the null mutations plc1Delta, gpr1Delta, gpa2Delta, and ras2Delta suggest that Plc1p acts together with Gpr1p and Gpa2p in a growth control pathway operating in parallel to the Ras2p function. Diploid cells lacking Gpr1p, Plc1p, or Gpa2p fail to form pseudohyphae upon nitrogen depletion, and the filamentation defect of gpr1Delta and plc1Delta strains is rescued by activating a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via STE11-4 or by activating a cAMP pathway via overexpressed Tpk2p. Plc1p is also required for efficient expression of the FG(TyA)::lacZ reporter gene under nitrogen depletion. In conclusion, we have identified two physically interacting proteins, Gpr1p and Plc1p, as novel components of a nitrogen signaling pathway controlling the developmental switch from yeast-like to pseudohyphal growth. Our data suggest that phospholipase C modulates the interaction of the putative nutrient sensor Gpr1p with the Galpha protein Gpa2p as a downstream effector of filamentation control.},

abstract = {Inoculation of diploid budding yeast onto nitrogen-poor agar media stimulates a MAPK pathway to promote filamentous growth. Characteristics of filamentous cells include a specific pattern of gene expression, elongated cell shape, polar budding pattern, persistent attachment to the mother cell, and a distinct cell cycle characterized by cell size control at G2/M. Although a requirement for MAPK signaling in filamentous gene expression is well established, the role of this pathway in the regulation of morphogenesis and the cell cycle remains obscure. We find that ectopic activation of the MAPK signal pathway induces a cell cycle shift to G2/M coordinately with other changes characteristic of filamentous growth. These effects are abrogated by overexpression of the yeast mitotic cyclins Clb1 and Clb2. In turn, yeast deficient for Clb2 or carrying cdc28-1N, an allele of CDK defective for mitotic functions, display enhanced filamentous differentiation and supersensitivity to the MAPK signal. Importantly, activation of Swe1-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Thr-18 and/or Tyr-19 of Cdc28 is not required for the MAPK pathway to affect the G2/M delay. Mutants expressing a nonphosphorylatable mutant Cdc28 or deficient for Swe1 exhibit low-nitrogen-dependent filamentous growth and are further induced by an ectopic MAPK signal. We infer that the MAPK pathway promotes filamentous growth by a novel mechanism that inhibits mitotic cyclin/CDK complexes and thereby modulates cell shape, budding pattern, and cell-cell connections.},

On a preferred nitrogen source diploid cells grow as ellipsoidal cells by using a bipolar pattern of budding, whereas on a poor nitrogen source a unipolar pattern of budding is adopted, resulting in extended pseudohyphal chains of filamentous cells. Here we report that the quality of the nitrogen source is signaled by the glutamine tRNA isoform with a 5'-CUG anticodon (tRNACUG). Mutations that alter this tRNA impair assessment of the nitrogen supply without measurably affecting protein synthesis, so that mutant cells display pseudohyphal growth even on a preferred nitrogen source. The nitrogen status for other nitrogen-responsive processes such as catabolic gene expression and sporulation also is signaled by this tRNA: mutant cells inappropriately induce the nitrogen-repressed gene CAR1 and undergo precocious sporulation in nitrogen-rich media. Therefore, in addition to its role in mRNA translation, this tRNA also transduces nitrogen signals that regulate development.},

abstract = {Accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II is usually dependent on the presence of a TATA element, and/or an initiator element, in the promoters of protein-encoding genes. The STA1-3 genes, encoding three glucoamylase isozymes (Sta1p, Sta2p and Sta3p, respectively) responsible for starch hydrolysis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been shown to contain long and complex promoters with several regulatory regions. These promoters are also virtually identical to the yeast MUC1 gene promoter; this gene encodes a mucin-like protein and is evolutionary linked to, and transcriptionally co-regulated with, STA1-3. The STA1-3 genes contain two putative TATA sequences; one conforming to the typical TATA box sequence, TATAAA, and another with the sequence of TATAAT. Here we present a study into the functional relevance of these putative TATA sequences and their effects on the transcription of the STA2 gene (as a representative model of the STA1-3 multigene family) and, by analogy, the MUC1 gene. We show that the TATAAA motif is the functional TATA box for STA2 and influences transcript levels, transcript initiation sites, and glucoamylase activities.},

abstract = {The activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone signal transduction pathway is regulated by Cln1/2-Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase. High level expression of CLN2 can repress activation of the pathway by mating factor or by deletion of the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein. We now show that CLN2 overexpression can also repress FUS1 induction if the signaling pathway is activated at the level of the beta-subunit of the G-protein (STE4) but not when activated at the level of downstream kinases (STE20 and STE11) or at the level of the transcription factor STE12. This epistatic analysis indicates that repression of pheromone signaling pathway by Cln2-Cdc28 kinase takes place at a level around STE20. In agreement with this, a marked reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of the Ste20 protein is observed at the time in the cell cycle of maximal expression of CLN2. This mobility change is constitutive in cells overexpressing CLN2 and absent in cells lacking CLN1 and CLN2. These changes in electrophoretic mobility correlate with repression of pheromone signaling and suggest Ste20 as a target for repression of signaling by G1 cyclins. Two morphogenic pathways for which Ste20 is essential, pseudohyphal differentiation and haploid-invasive growth, also require CLN1 and CLN2. Together with the previous observation that Cln1 and Cln2 are required for the function of Ste20 in cytokinesis, this suggests that Cln1 and Cln2 regulate the biological activity of Ste20 by promoting morphogenic functions, while inhibiting the mating factor signal transduction function.},

At least three pathways are involved in regulating the transition between these two forms in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and evidence is now emerging that homologous signalling modules are involved in regulating filament formation and virulence in a range of human and plant fungal pathogens.

abstract = {In response to nitrogen starvation, diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiate into a filamentous, pseudohyphal growth form. This dimorphic transition is regulated by the Galpha protein GPA2, by RAS2, and by elements of the pheromone-responsive MAP kinase cascade, yet the mechanisms by which nitrogen starvation is sensed remain unclear. We have found that MEP2, a high affinity ammonium permease, is required for pseudohyphal differentiation in response to ammonium limitation. In contrast, MEP1 and MEP3, which are lower affinity ammonium permeases, are not required for filamentous growth. Deltamep2 mutant strains had no defects in growth rates or ammonium uptake, even at limiting ammonium concentrations. The pseudohyphal defect of Deltamep2/Deltamep2 strains was suppressed by dominant active GPA2 or RAS2 mutations and by addition of exogenous cAMP, but was not suppressed by activated alleles of the MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of MEP1/MEP2 hybrid proteins identified a small intracellular loop of MEP2 involved in the pseudohyphal regulatory function. In addition, mutations in GLN3, URE2 and NPR1, which abrogate MEP2 expression or stability, also conferred pseudohyphal growth defects. We propose that MEP2 is an ammonium sensor, generating a signal to regulate filamentous growth in response to ammonium starvation.},

abstract = {Nitrogen-starved diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiate into a filamentous, pseudohyphal growth form. Recognition of nitrogen starvation is mediated, at least in part, by the ammonium permease Mep2p and the Galpha subunit Gpa2p. Genetic activation of the pheromone-responsive MAP kinase cascade, which is also required for filamentous growth, only weakly suppresses the filamentation defect of Deltamep2/Deltamep2 and Deltagpa2/Deltagpa2 strain. Surprisingly, deletion of Mep1p, an ammonium permease not previously thought to regulate differentiation, significantly enhances the potency of MAP kinase activation, such that the STE11-4 allele induces filamentation to near wild-type levels in Deltamep1/Deltamep1 Deltamep2/Deltamep2 and Deltamep1/Deltamep1 Deltagpa2/Deltagpa2 strains. To identify additional regulatory components, we isolated high-copy suppressors of the filamentation defect of the Deltamep1/Deltamep1 Deltamep2/Deltamep2 mutant. Multicopy expression of TEC1, PHD1, PHD2 (MSS10/MSN1/FUP4), MSN5, CDC6, MSS11, MGA1, SKN7, DOT6, HMS1, HMS2, or MEP2 each restored filamentation in a Deltamep1/Deltamep1 Deltamep2/Deltamep2 strain. Overexpression of SRK1 (SSD1), URE2, DAL80, MEP1, or MEP3 suppressed only the growth defect of the Deltamep1/Deltamep1 Deltamep2/Deltamep2 mutant strain. Characterization of these genes through deletion analysis and epistasis underscores the complexity of this developmental pathway and suggests that stress conditions other than nitrogen deprivation may also promote filamentous growth.},

@article{Lo1998,
abstract = {Diploid yeast develop pseudohyphae in response to nitrogen starvation, while haploid yeast produce invasive filaments which penetrate the agar in rich medium. We have identified a gene, FLO11, that encodes a cell wall protein which is critically required for both invasion and pseudohyphae formation in response to nitrogen starvation. FLO11 encodes a cell surface flocculin with a structure similar to the class of yeast serine/threonine-rich GPI-anchored cell wall proteins. Cells of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Sigma1278b with deletions of FLO11 do not form pseudohyphae as diploids nor invade agar as haploids. In rich media, FLO11 is regulated by mating type; it is expressed in haploid cells but not in diploids. Upon transfer to nitrogen starvation media, however, FLO11 transcripts accumulate in diploid cells, but not in haploids. Overexpression of FLO11 in diploid cells, which are otherwise not invasive, enables them to invade agar. Thus, the mating type repression of FLO11 in diploids grown in rich media suffices to explain the inability of these cells to invade. The promoter of FLO11 contains a consensus binding sequence for Ste12p and Tec1p, proteins known to cooperatively activate transcription of Ty1 elements and the TEC1 gene during development of pseudohyphae. Yeast with a deletion of STE12 does not express FLO11 transcripts, indicating that STE12 is required for FLO11 expression. These ste12-deletion strains also do not invade agar. However, the ability to invade can be restored by overexpressing FLO11. Activation of FLO11 may thus be the primary means by which Ste12p and Tec1p cause invasive growth.},

Overexpression of STE11 also suppresses the mating defects of ste50 mutants. We have analysed the physical association between Ste50p and Ste11p in extracts of cells harvested under various conditions. A Ste11p-Ste50p complex can be isolated from extracts of cells in which the pheromone response has been activated, as well as from normally growing cells. Formation of the Ste50p-Ste11p complex does not require G(alpha), G(beta), Ste20p or Ste5p. Oligomerisation of Ste11p is shown to be independent of activation of the pheromone response pathway, and occurs in the absence of Ste50p.

Because Ash1 has a zinc finger-like domain related to that of the GATA family of transcription factors, it presumably acts by repressing HO transcription. Nonswitching diploid cells also express Ash1, suggesting it could have functions in addition to regulation of HO expression. We show here that Ash1 has an essential function for pseudohyphal growth. Our epistasis analyses are consistent with the deduction that Ash1 acts separately from the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and Ste12. Similarly to the case in yeast form cells, Ash1 is asymmetrically localized to the nuclei of daughter cells during pseudohyphal growth. This asymmetric localization reveals that there is a previously unsuspected daughter cell-specific function necessary for pseudohyphal growth.},

@article{Banuett1998,
abstract = {All cells, from bacteria and yeasts to mammalian cells, respond to cues from their environment. A variety of mechanisms exist for the transduction of these external signals to the interior of the cell, resulting in altered patterns of protein activity. Eukaryotic cells commonly transduce external cues via a conserved module composed of three protein kinases, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This module can then activate substrates, some of which include transcriptional activators. Multiple MAPK signalling pathways coexist in a cell. This review considers different MAPK cascade signalling pathways that govern several aspects of the life cycle of budding and fission yeasts: conjugation and meiosis by the pheromone response pathway, stress response by the high-osmolarity sensing pathway, cell wall biosynthesis in response to activation of the low-osmolarity and heat-sensing pathway, and pseudohyphal growth in response to activation of a subset of the components of the pheromone response pathway. Because the MAPK cascade components are highly conserved, a key question in studies of these pathways is the mechanism by which specificity of response is achieved. Several other issues to be addressed in this review concern the nature of the receptors used to sense the external signals and the mechanism by which the receptors communicate with other components leading to activation of the MAPK cascade. Recently, it has become apparent that MAPK cascades are important in governing the pathogenicity of filamentous fungi.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dimorphic and switches from a yeast form to a pseudohyphal (PH) form when starved for nitrogen. PH cells are elongated, bud in a unipolar manner, and invade the agar substrate. We assessed the requirements for actin in mediating the dramatic morphogenetic events that accompany the transition to PH growth. Twelve "alanine scan" alleles of the single yeast actin gene (ACT1) were tested for effects on filamentation, unipolar budding, agar invasion, and cell elongation. Some act1 mutations affect all phenotypes, whereas others affect only one or two aspects of PH growth. Tests of intragenic complementation among specific act1 mutations support the phenotypic evidence for multiple actin functions in filamentous growth. We present evidence that interaction between actin and the actin-binding protein fimbrin is important for PH growth and suggest that association of different actin-binding proteins with actin mediates the multiple functions of actin in filamentous growth. Furthermore, characterization of cytoskeletal structure in wild type and act1/act1 mutants indicates that PH cell morphogenesis requires the maintenance of a highly polarized actin cytoskeleton. Collectively, this work demonstrates that actin plays a central role in fungal dimorphism.},

abstract = {The WHI2 gene of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for the arrest of cell proliferation upon nutrient exhaustion: whi2 mutants carry on dividing and in the absence of growth become abnormally small. It is reported here that overexpression of Whi2 from the GAL1 promoter results in filamentous growth - cells fail to complete cytokinesis, the budding pattern changes from axial to polar, cells become elongated and cell size increases threefold. In many ways, these filaments resemble the pseudohyphae which result from nitrogen-limited growth and the filaments seen during the invasive growth of haploids. However, Whi2-induced filament formation is reduced, but not blocked, by mutations in STE7, STE12 or STE20 which do block pseudohypha formation. Furthermore, pseudohypha formation can still occur in a diploid in which both copies of the WHI2 gene have been deleted. Thus Whi2-induced filament formation and pseudohypha formation must come about through the action of different pathways. Despite this, a mutation in the STE11 gene, which is required for pseudohypha formation, does block Whi2-induced filament formation. Concanavalin A pulse-chase experiments show that new cell wall material is incorporated only into the tips of the apical cells. An extragenic suppressor of the Whi2 allele also results in filamentous growth. These results suggest that Whi2 negatively regulates a function required for the budding mode of cell proliferation including cytokinesis. This function is defined wholly or in part by the fsw1 allele.},

abstract = {14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved ubiquitous proteins whose explicit functions have remained elusive. Here, we show that the S. cerevisiae 14-3-3 homologs BMH1 and BMH2 are not essential for viability or mating MAPK cascade signaling, but they are essential for pseudohyphal-development MAPK cascade signaling and other processes. Activated alleles of RAS2 and CDC42 induce pseudohyphal development and FG(TyA)-lacZ signaling in Bmh+ strains but not in ste20 (p65PAK) or bmh1 bmh2 mutant strains. Moreover, Bmh1p and Bmh2p associate with Ste20p in vivo. Three alleles of BMH1 encode proteins defective for FG(TyA)-lacZ signaling and association with Ste20p, yet these alleles complement other 14-3-3 functions. Therefore, the 14-3-3 proteins are specifically required for RAS/MAPK cascade signaling during pseudohyphal development in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {BEM2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a Rho-type GTPase-activating protein that is required for proper bud site selection at 26 degrees C and for bud emergence at elevated temperatures. We show here that the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of bem2 mutant cells can be suppressed by increased dosage of the GIC1 gene. The Gic1 protein, together with its structural homolog Gic2, are required for cell size and shape control, bud site selection, bud emergence, actin cytoskeletal organization, mitotic spindle orientation/positioning, and mating projection formation in response to mating pheromone. Each protein contains a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding) motif and each interacts in the two-hybrid assay with the GTP-bound form of the Rho-type Cdc42 GTPase, a key regulator of polarized growth in yeast. The CRIB motif of Gic1 and the effector domain of Cdc42 are required for this association. Genetic experiments indicate that Gic1 and Gic2 play positive roles in the Cdc42 signal transduction pathway, probably as effectors of Cdc42. Subcellular localization studies with a functional green fluorescent protein-Gic1 fusion protein indicate that this protein is concentrated at the incipient bud site of unbudded cells, at the bud tip and mother-bud neck of budded cells, and at cortical sites on large-budded cells that may delimit future bud sites in the two progeny cells. The ability of Gic1 to associate with Cdc42 is important for its function but is apparently not essential for its subcellular localization.},

abstract = {Pseudohyphal differentiation, a filamentous growth form of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is induced by nitrogen starvation. The mechanisms by which nitrogen limitation regulates this process are currently unknown. We have found that GPA2, one of the two heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit homologs in yeast, regulates pseudohyphal differentiation. Deltagpa2/Deltagpa2 mutant strains have a defect in pseudohyphal growth. In contrast, a constitutively active allele of GPA2 stimulates filamentation, even on nitrogen-rich media. Moreover, a dominant negative GPA2 allele inhibits filamentation of wild-type strains. Several findings, including epistasis analysis and reporter gene studies, indicate that GPA2 does not regulate the MAP kinase cascade known to regulate filamentous growth. Previous studies have implicated GPA2 in the control of intracellular cAMP levels; we find that expression of the dominant RAS2(Gly19Val) mutant or exogenous cAMP suppresses the Deltagpa2 pseudohyphal defect. cAMP also stimulates filamentation in strains lacking the cAMP phosphodiesterase PDE2, even in the absence of nitrogen starvation. Our findings suggest that GPA2 is an element of the nitrogen sensing machinery that regulates pseudohyphal differentiation by modulating cAMP levels.},

abstract = {Little is known about the pathways used by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases to induce the events of the cell cycle. In budding yeast, a protein called Nap1 binds to the mitotic cyclin Clb2, and Nap1 is required for the ability of Clb2 to induce specific mitotic events, but the role played by Nap1 is unclear. We have used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify additional proteins that function with Nap1 in the control of mitotic events. These approaches have both identified a protein kinase called Gin4 that is required for the ability of Clb2 and Nap1 to promote the switch from polar to isotropic bud growth that normally occurs during mitosis. Gin4 is also required for the ability of Clb2 and Nap1 to promote normal progression through mitosis. The Gin4 protein becomes phosphorylated as cells enter mitosis, resulting in the activation of Gin4 kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Gin4 is dependent upon Nap1 and Clb2 in vivo. Affinity chromatography experiments demonstrate that Gin4 binds tightly to Nap1, indicating that the functions of these two proteins are closely tied within the cell. These results demonstrate that the activation of Gin4 is under the control of Clb2 and Nap1, and they provide an important step towards elucidating the molecular pathways that link cyclin-dependent kinases to the events they control.},

abstract = {RAS2val19, a dominant activated form of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras2, stimulates both filamentous growth and expression of a transcriptional reporter FG(TyA)::lacZ but does not induce the mating pathway reporter FUS1::lacZ. This induction depends upon elements of the conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that is required for both filamentous growth and mating, two distinct morphogenetic events. Full induction requires Ste20 (homolog of mammalian p65PAK protein kinases), Ste11 [an MEK kinase (MEKK) or MAPK kinase (MEK) kinase], Ste7 (MEK or MAPK kinase), and the transcription factor Ste12. Moreover, the Rho family protein Cdc42, a conserved morphogenetic G protein, is also a potent regulator of filamentous growth and FG(TyA)::lacZ expression in S. cerevisiae. Stimulation of both filamentous growth and FG(TyA)::lacZ by Cdc42 depends upon Ste20. In addition, dominant negative CDC42Ala118 blocks RAS2val19 activation, placing Cdc42 downstream of Ras2.

Here we report that haploid and diploid starch-degrading S. cerevisiae strains were able to switch from a yeast form to a filamentous pseudohyphal form in response to carbon limitation in the presence of an ample supply of nitrogen. Two genes, MSS10 and MUC1, were cloned and shown to be involved in pseudohyphal differentiation and invasive growth. The deletion of MSS10 resulted in extremely reduced amounts of pseudohyphal differentiation and invasive growth, whereas the deletion of MUC1 abolished pseudohyphal differentiation and invasive growth completely. Mss10 appears to be a transcriptional activator that responds to nutrient limitation and coregulates the expression of MUC1 and the STA1-3 glucoamylase genes, which are involved in starch degradation. MUC1 encodes a 1367-amino acid protein, containing several serine/threonine-rich repeats. Muc1 is a putative integral membrane-bound protein, similar to mammalian mucin-like membrane proteins that have been implicated to play a role in the ability of cancer cells to invade other tissues.},

abstract = {Yeast cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity is essential for growth and cell cycle progression. Dependence on PKA function can be partially relieved by overexpression of a gene, SOK2, whose product has significant homology with several fungal transcription factors (StuA from Aspergillus nidulans and Phd1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that are associated with cellular differentiation and development. Deletion of SOK2 is not lethal but exacerbates the growth defect of strains compromised for PKA activity. Alterations in Sok2 protein production also affect the expression of genes involved in several other PKA-regulated processes, including glycogen accumulation (GAC1) and heat shock resistance (SSA3). These results suggest SOK2 plays a general regulatory role in the PKA signal transduction pathway. Expression of the PKA catalytic subunit genes is unaltered by deletion or overexpression of SOK2. Because homozygous sok2/sok2 diploid strains form pseudohyphae at an accelerated rate, the Sok2 protein may inhibit the switch from unicellular to filamentous growth, a process that is dependent on cAMP. Thus, the product of SOK2 may act downstream of PKA to regulate the expression of genes important in growth and development.},

abstract = {NAP1 is a 60-kD protein that interacts specifically with mitotic cyclins in budding yeast and frogs. We have examined the ability of the yeast mitotic cyclin Clb2 to function in cells that lack NAP1. Our results demonstrate that Clb2 is unable to carry out its full range of functions without NAP1, even though Clb2/p34CDC28-associated kinase activity rises to normal levels. In the absence of NAP1, Clb2 is unable to efficiently induce mitotic events, and cells undergo a prolonged delay at the short spindle stage with normal levels of Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase activity. NAP1 is also required for the ability of Clb2 to induce the switch from polar to isotropic bud growth. As a result, polar bud growth continues during mitosis, giving rise to highly elongated cells. Our experiments also suggest that NAP1 is required for the ability of the Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase complex to amplify its own production, and that NAP1 plays a role in regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Together, these results demonstrate that NAP1 is required for the normal function of the activated Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase complex, and provide a step towards understanding how cyclin-dependent kinase complexes induce specific events during the cell cycle.},

abstract = {The G protein-coupled alpha-factor receptor promotes polarized growth toward a mating partner. alpha-Factor induces the expression of AFR1, which acts together with the receptor C terminus to promote normal morphogenesis. The function of AFR1 was investigated by engineering cells to constitutively express AFR1 without alpha-factor. Constitutive AFR1 expression caused cells to form elongated buds that demonstrate that AFR1 can also interact with the morphogenesis components that promote bud formation. A similar elongated bud phenotype is caused by mutation of the CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, and CDC12 genes, which encode putative filament proteins that form a ring at the bud neck. AFR1 may act directly on the filament proteins, since immunolocalization detected AFR1 at the bud neck and interaction of AFR1 and CDC12 was detected in the two-hybrid protein assay. AFR1 localized to the base of pheromone-induced projections. These results suggest that AFR1 and the putative filament proteins act together with the receptor to facilitate proper localization of components during mating.},

abstract = {Laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are dimorphic; in response to nitrogen starvation they switch from a yeast form (YF) to a filamentous pseudohyphal (PH) form. Time-lapse video microscopy of dividing cells reveals that YF and PH cells differ in their cell cycles and budding polarity. The YF cell cycle is controlled at the G1/S transition by the cell-size checkpoint Start. YF cells divide asymmetrically, producing small daughters from full-sized mothers. As a result, mothers and daughters bud asynchronously. Mothers bud immediately but daughters grow in G1 until they achieve a critical cell size. By contrast, PH cells divide symmetrically, restricting mitosis until the bud grows to the size of the mother. Thus, mother and daughter bud synchronously in the next cycle, without a G1 delay before Start. YF and PH cells also exhibit distinct bud-site selection patterns. YF cells are bipolar, producing their second and subsequent buds at either pole. PH cells are unipolar, producing their second and subsequent buds only from the end opposite the junction with their mother. We propose that in PH cells a G2 cell-size checkpoint delays mitosis until bud size reaches that of the mother cell. We conclude that yeast and PH forms are distinct cell types each with a unique cell cycle, budding pattern, and cell shape.},

abstract = {Casein kinase I is an acidotropic protein kinase class that is widely distributed among eukaryotic cell types. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the casein kinase I isoform encoded by the gene pair YCK1 and YCK2 is a 60- to 62-kDa membrane-associated form. The Yck proteins perform functions essential for growth and division; either alone supports growth, but loss of function of both is lethal. We report here that casein kinase I-like activity is associated with a soluble Yck2-beta-galactosidase fusion protein in vitro and that thermolabile protein kinase activity is exhibited by a protein encoded by fusion of a temperature-sensitive yck2 allele with lacZ. Cells carrying the yck2-2ts allele arrest at restrictive temperature with multiple, elongated buds containing multiple nuclei. This phenotype suggests that the essential functions of the Yck proteins include roles in bud morphogenesis, possibly in control of cell growth polarity, and in cytokinesis or cell separation. Further, a genetic relationship between the yck2ts allele and deletion of CDC55 indicates that the function of Yck phosphorylation may be related to that of protein phosphatase 2A activity.},

@article{Lew1993,
abstract = {Analysis of cell cycle regulation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that a central regulatory protein kinase, Cdc28, undergoes changes in activity through the cell cycle by associating with distinct groups of cyclins that accumulate at different times. The various cyclin/Cdc28 complexes control different aspects of cell cycle progression, including the commitment step known as START and mitosis. We found that altering the activity of Cdc28 had profound effects on morphogenesis during the yeast cell cycle. Our results suggest that activation of Cdc28 by G1 cyclins (Cln1, Cln2, or Cln3) in unbudded G1 cells triggers polarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton to a specialized pre-bud site at one end of the cell, while activation of Cdc28 by mitotic cyclins (Clb1 or Clb2) in budded G2 cells causes depolarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and secretory apparatus. Inactivation of Cdc28 following cyclin destruction in mitosis triggers redistribution of cortical actin structures to the neck region for cytokinesis. In the case of pre-bud site assembly following START, we found that the actin rearrangement could be triggered by Cln/Cdc28 activation in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that the kinase may directly phosphorylate substrates (such as actin-binding proteins) that regulate actin distribution in cells.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC42 gene product, a member of the ras superfamily of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins, is involved in the control of cell polarity. We have analyzed the effects of three CDC42 mutations (Gly to Val-12, Gln to Leu-61, and Asp to Ala-118) in the putative GTP-binding and hydrolysis domains and one mutation (Cys to Ser-188) in the putative isoprenylation site. The first three mutations resulted in either a dominant-lethal or dose-dependent dominant-lethal phenotype when present on plasmids in haploid cdc42-1ts or wild-type strains. Both wild-type and cdc42-1ts cells carrying plasmids (pGAL) with either the CDC42Val-12 or CDC42Leu-61 alleles under the control of a GAL promoter were arrested with a novel phenotype of large cells with elongated or multiple buds. Cells carrying pGAL-CDC42Ala-118 were arrested as large, round, unbudded cells reminiscent of cdc42-1ts arrested cells. The different phenotype of the CDC42Ala-118 mutant versus the CDC42Val-12 and CDC42Leu-61 mutants was unexpected since the phenotypes of all three analogous ras mutants were similar to each other. This suggests that aspects of the biochemical properties of the Cdc42 protein differ from those of the Ras protein. The cdc42Ser-188 mutant gene was incapable of complementing the cdc42-1ts mutation and was recessive to both wild-type and cdc42-1ts. In double-mutant alleles, the cdc42Ser-188 mutation was capable of suppressing the dominant lethality associated with the three putative GTP-binding and hydrolysis mutations, suggesting that isoprenylation is necessary for the activity of the wild-type and mutant proteins.},

At restrictive temperature, the original cdc55 mutant produces abnormally elongated buds and displays a delay or partial block of septation and/or cell separation. A cdc55 deletion mutant displays a cold-sensitive phenotype like that of the original isolate. Sequencing of CDC55 revealed that it encodes a protein of about 60 kDa, as confirmed by Western immunoblots using Cdc55p-specific antibodies. This protein has greater than 50{\%} sequence identity to the B subunits of rabbit skeletal muscle type 2A protein phosphatase; the latter sequences were obtained by analysis of peptides derived from the purified protein, a polymerase chain reaction product, and cDNA clones.

abstract = {The distribution of actin in wild-type cells and in morphogenetic mutants of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was explored by staining cells with fluorochrome-labeled phallotoxins after fixing and permeabilizing the cells by several methods. The actin appeared to be localized in a set of cortical spots or patches, as well as in a network of cytoplasmic fibers. Bundles of filaments that may possibly correspond to the fibers visualized by fluorescence were observed with the electron microscope. The putative actin spots were concentrated in small and medium-sized buds and at what were apparently the sites of incipient bud formation on unbudded cells, whereas the putative actin fibers were generally oriented along the long axes of the mother-bud pairs. In several morphogenetic mutants that form multiple, abnormally elongated buds, the actin patches were conspicuously clustered at the tips of most buds, and actin fibers were clearly oriented along the long axes of the buds. There was a strong correlation between the occurrence of active growth at particular bud tips and clustering of actin spots at those same tips. Near the end of the cell cycle in wild-type cells, actin appeared to concentrate (as a cluster of spots or a band) in the neck region connecting the mother cell to its bud. Observations made using indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal anti-yeast-tubulin antibody on the morphogenetic mutant cdc4 (which forms multiple, abnormally elongated buds while the nuclear cycle is arrested) revealed the surprising occurrence of multiple bundles of cytoplasmic microtubules emanating from the one duplicated spindle-pole body per cell. It seems that most or all of the buds contain one or more of these bundles of microtubules, which often can be seen to extend to the very tips of the buds. These observations are consistent with the hypotheses that actin, tubulin, or both may be involved in the polarization of growth and localization of cell-wall deposition that occurs during the yeast cell cycle.},

abstract = {Formation of amyloid fibrils is involved in a range of fatal human disorders including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases. Yeast prions, despite differences in sequence from their mammalian counterparts, share similar features with mammalian prions including infectivity, prion strain phenomenon, and species barrier and thus are good model systems for human prion diseases. Yeast prions normally have long prion domains that presumably form multiple $\beta$ strands in the fibril, and structural knowledge about the yeast prion fibrils has been limited. Here we use site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to investigate the structures of amyloid fibrils of Ure2 prion domain. We show that 15 spin-labeled Ure2 mutants, with spin labels at every 5th residue from position 5 to position 75, show a single-line or nearly single-line feature in their EPR spectra as a result of strong spin exchange interactions. These results suggest that a parallel in-register $\beta$ structure exists at these spin-labeled positions. More interestingly, we also show that residues in the segment 30-65 have stronger spin exchange interactions, higher local stability, and lower solvent accessibility than segments 5-25 and 70-75, suggesting different local environment at these segments. We propose a hierarchical organization in the amyloid core of Ure2, with the segment 30-65 forming an inner core and the segments 5-25 and 70-75 forming an outer core. The hierarchical organization in the amyloid core may be a structural origin for polymorphism in fibrils and prion strains.},

We then analysed the regulatory function of Ure2p, using a deletion of URE2. We assessed the deregulation of two reporter genes: DAL5 and GDH2. Both were derepressed in the mutant strain, as in Saccharomyces. Finally, we tried to obtain the [URE3] prion from K. lactis. Despite the use of many different experimental conditions, we were unable to obtain a prion from Ure2p. This finding calls into question the extent to which the prion form of Ure2p may be considered an evolutionary adaptation, instead suggesting that an exaptation phenomenon may be more likely than a continuous selection history.},

abstract = {The yeast inheritable phenotype [URE3] is thought to result from conformational changes in the normally soluble and highly helical protein Ure2p. In vitro, the protein spontaneously forms long, straight, insoluble protein fibrils at neutral pH. Here we show that fibrils of intact Ure2p assembled in vitro do not possess the cross beta-structure of amyloid, but instead are formed by the polymerization of native-like helical subunits that retain the ability to bind substrate analogues. We further show that dissociation of the normally dimeric protein to its constituent monomers is a prerequisite for assembly into fibrils. By analysing the nature of early assembly intermediates, as well as fully assembled Ure2p fibrils using atomic force microscopy, and combining the results with experiments that probe the fidelity of the native fold in protein fibrils, we present a model for fibril formation, based on assembly of native-like monomers, driven by interactions between the N-terminal glutamine and asparagine-rich region and the C-terminal functional domain. The results provide a rationale for the effect of mutagenesis on prion formation and new insights into the mechanism by which this, and possibly other inheritable factors, can be propagated.},

abstract = {A long-standing question in the study of long-term memory is how a memory trace persists for years when the proteins that initiated the process turn over and disappear within days. Previously, we postulated that self-sustaining amyloidogenic oligomers of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) provide a mechanism for the maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic changes and, thus, the persistence of memory. Here, we found that the Drosophila CPEB Orb2 forms amyloid-like oligomers, and oligomers are enriched in the synaptic membrane fraction. Of the two protein isoforms of Orb2, the amyloid-like oligomer formation is dependent on the Orb2A form. A point mutation in the prion-like domain of Orb2A, which reduced amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2, did not interfere with learning or memory persisting up to 24 hr. However the mutant flies failed to stabilize memory beyond 48 hr. These results support the idea that amyloid-like oligomers of neuronal CPEB are critical for the persistence of long-term memory.},

abstract = {Variation in pathology of human prion disease is believed to be caused, in part, by distinct conformations of aggregated protein resulting in different prion strains. Several prions also exist in yeast and maintain different self-propagating structures, referred to as prion variants. Investigation of the yeast prion [PSI(+)] has been instrumental in deciphering properties of prion variants and modeling the physical basis of their formation. Here, we describe the generation of specific variants of the [RNQ(+)] prion in yeast transformed with fibers formed in vitro in different conditions. The fibers of the Rnq1p prion-forming domain (PFD) that induce different variants in vivo have distinct biochemical properties. The physical basis of propagation of prion variants has been previously correlated to rates of aggregation and disaggregation. With [RNQ(+)] prion variants, we found that the prion variant does not correlate with the rate of aggregation as anticipated but does correlate with stability. Interestingly, we found that there are differences in the ability of the [RNQ(+)] prion variants to faithfully propagate themselves and to template the aggregation of other proteins. Incorporating the mechanism of variant formation elucidated in this study with that previously proposed for [PSI(+)] variants has provided a framework to separate general characteristics of prion variant properties from those specific to individual prion proteins.},

L-A has a single-segment 4.6-kb linear genome encoding a major coat protein (gag) and its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (pol), the latter expressed as a gag-pol fusion protein formed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift. In vitro replication, transcription, and binding systems for L-A have been used to define cis sites necessary for packaging and replication of viral RNA. Cellular functions that promote viral replication include the MAK3-encoded N-acetyltransferase whose modification of the gag N terminus is necessary for L-A virus assembly. The toxins encoded by the M satellite RNAs are processed by enzymes (KEX1 and KEX2, for killer expression) whose study led to discovery of mammalian hormone-processing enzymes. 20S RNA is an apparently naked circular RNA replicon (with a dsRNA form called W) encoding a RNA polymerase-like molecule. Its copy number is induced 10,000-fold in 1{\%} potassium acetate, and it is subject to the same SKI antiviral system that represses L-A, L-BC, and M dsRNA copy number.},

abstract = {Fungal prions are fascinating protein-based genetic elements. They alter cellular phenotypes through self-perpetuating changes in protein conformation and are cytoplasmically partitioned from mother cell to daughter. The four prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Podospora anserina affect diverse biological processes: translational termination, nitrogen regulation, inducibility of other prions, and heterokaryon incompatibility. They share many attributes, including unusual genetic behaviors, that establish criteria to identify new prions. Indeed, other fungal traits that baffled microbiologists meet some of these criteria and might be caused by prions. Recent research has provided notable insight about how prions are induced and propagated and their many biological roles. The ability to become a prion appears to be evolutionarily conserved in two cases. [PSI(+)] provides a mechanism for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity in response to changing environments. All available evidence suggests that prions epigenetically modulate a wide variety of fundamental biological processes, and many await discovery.},

abstract = {Our work suggests that the forces that govern protein folding exert a profound effect on how genotypes are translated into phenotypes and that this in turn has strong effects on evolutionary processes. Molecular chaperones, also known as "heat-shock proteins" (Hsps), promote the correct folding and maturation of many other proteins in the cell. Hsp90 is an abundant and highly specialized chaperone that works on a particularly interesting group of client proteins: metastable signal transducers that are key regulators of a broad spectrum of biological processes. Such proteins often have evolved to finish folding only when they have received a specific signal, such as the binding of a ligand or a posttranslational modification. Importantly, the folding of Hsp90 clients is particularly sensitive to changes in the external and internal environment of the cell. Therefore, Hsp90 is uniquely positioned to couple environmental contingencies to the evolution of new traits. Our work has helped to define two mechanisms by which Hsp90 might influence the acquisition of new phenotypes. First, by robustly maintaining signaling pathways, Hsp90 can buffer the effects of mutations in those pathways, allowing the storage of cryptic genetic variation that is released by stress. In this case, when the Hsp90 buffer is compromised by environmental stress, new traits appear. These traits can also be assimilated, so that they become manifest even in the absence of stress, when genetic recombination and selection enrich causative variants in subsequent generations. Second, Hsp90 can potentiate the effects of genetic variation, allowing new mutations to produce immediate phenotypes. In this case, when Hsp90 function is compromised, new traits are lost. These traits can also be assimilated, so that they are maintained under environmental stress, but this is achieved through new mutations. We have discovered these powerful evolutionary mechanisms in fruit flies, mustard plants, and fungi, but expect them to operate in all eukaryotes. Another line of work relating protein folding to the evolution of new traits involves protein-based hereditary elements known as prions. These produce changes in phenotype through heritable, self-perpetuating changes in protein conformation. Because changes in protein homeostasis occur with environmental stress, prions can be cured or induced by stress, creating heritable new phenotypes that depend on the genetic variation present in the organism. Both prions and Hsp90 provide plausible mechanisms for allowing genetic diversity and fluctuating environments to fuel the pace of evolutionary change. The multiple mechanisms by which protein folding can influence the evolution of new traits provide both a new paradigm for understanding rapid, stepwise evolution and a framework for targeted therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {The [PSI+] factor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an epigenetic regulator of translation termination. More than three decades ago, genetic analysis of the transmission of [PSI+] revealed a complex and often contradictory series of observations. However, many of these discrepancies may now be reconciled by a revolutionary hypothesis: protein conformation-based inheritance (the prion hypothesis). This model predicts that a single protein can stably exist in at least two distinct physical states, each associated with a different phenotype. Propagation of one of these traits is achieved by a self-perpetuating change in the protein from one form to the other. Mounting genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the determinant of [PSI+] is the nuclear encoded Sup35p, a component of the translation termination complex. Here we review the series of experiments supporting the yeast prion hypothesis and provide another look at the 30 years of work preceding this theory in light of our current state of knowledge.},

abstract = {The prions (infectious proteins) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are proteins acting as genes, by templating their conformation from one molecule to another in analogy to DNA templating its sequence. Most yeast prions are amyloid forms of normally soluble proteins, and a single protein sequence can have any of several self-propagating forms (called prion strains or variants), analogous to the different possible alleles of a DNA gene. A central issue in prion biology is the structural basis of this conformational templating process. The in-register parallel $\beta$ sheet structure found for several infectious yeast prion amyloids naturally suggests an explanation for this conformational templating. While most prions are plainly diseases, the [Het-s] prion of Podospora anserina may be a functional amyloid, with important structural implications. Yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general, particularly because new evidence is showing infectious aspects of several human amyloidoses not previously classified as prions. We also review studies of the roles of chaperones, aggregate-collecting proteins, and other cellular components using yeast that have led the way in improving the understanding of similar processes that must be operating in many human amyloidoses.},

Studies of the mechanisms of virus and prion replication, virus structure, and structure of the amyloid filaments that are the basis of yeast prions have been at the forefront of such studies in these classes of infectious entities. Yeast has been particularly useful in defining the interactions of the infectious elements with cellular components: chromosomally encoded proteins necessary for blocking the propagation of the viruses and prions, and proteins involved in the expression of viral components. Here, we emphasize the L-A dsRNA virus and its killer-toxin-encoding satellites, the 20S and 23S ssRNA naked viruses, and the several infectious proteins (prions) of yeast.},

abstract = {The molecular investigation of the amyloidoses began in the mid-19th century with the observation of areas in human tissues obtained at autopsy that were homogeneous and eosinophilic with conventional stains but became blue when exposed to mixtures of iodine and sulfuric acid. The foci corresponded to regions formerly identified as "waxy" or lardaceous. Subsequent identification of the characteristic staining of the same tissues with metachromatic dyes such as crystal violet or with the cotton dye Congo red (particularly under polarized light) and thioflavins allowed the pathological classification of those tissues as belonging to a set of disorders known as the amyloidoses. Not unexpectedly, progress has reflected evolving technology and parallel advances in all fields of biological science. Investigation using contemporary methods has expanded our notions of amyloid proteins from being simply agents or manifestations of systemic, largely extracellular diseases to include "protein-only infection," the concept that "normal" functional amyloids might exist in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and that aggregatability may be an intrinsic structural price to be paid for some functional protein domains. We now distinguish between the amyloidoses, that is, diseases caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils and amyloid proteins (i.e., purified or recombinant proteins that form amyloid fibrils in vitro), which may or may not be associated with disease in vivo.},

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model organism to study basic mechanisms for how cellular pathways regulate amyloid assembly and proteotoxicity. For example, studies of the amyloidogenic yeast prion [RNQ(+)] have revealed novel roles by which molecular chaperones protect cells from the accumulation of cytotoxic protein species. In budding yeast there are a variety of cellular assays that can be employed to analyze the assembly of amyloid-like aggregates and mechanistically dissect how cellular pathways influence proteotoxicity. In this review, we describe several assays that are routinely used to investigate aggregation and toxicity of the [RNQ(+)] prion in yeast.},

Many discoveries have strongly supported the prion hypothesis, but only recently has this once heretical hypothesis been widely accepted by the scientific community. In the past 3 years, researchers have achieved the 'Holy Grail' demonstration that infectious material can be generated in vitro using completely defined components. These breakthroughs have proven that a misfolded protein is the active component of the infectious agent, and that propagation of the disease and its unique features depend on the self-replication of the infectious folding of the prion protein. In spite of these important discoveries, it remains unclear whether another molecule besides the misfolded prion protein might be an essential element of the infectious agent. Future research promises to reveal many more intriguing features about the rogue prions.},

abstract = {The yeast and fungal prions determine heritable and infectious traits, and are thus genes composed of protein. Most prions are inactive forms of a normal protein as it forms a self-propagating filamentous $\beta$-sheet-rich polymer structure called amyloid. Remarkably, a single prion protein sequence can form two or more faithfully inherited prion variants, in effect alleles of these genes. What protein structure explains this protein-based inheritance? Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we showed that the infectious amyloids of the prion domains of Ure2p, Sup35p and Rnq1p have an in-register parallel architecture. This structure explains how the amyloid filament ends can template the structure of a new protein as it joins the filament. The yeast prions [PSI(+)] and [URE3] are not found in wild strains, indicating that they are a disadvantage to the cell. Moreover, the prion domains of Ure2p and Sup35p have functions unrelated to prion formation, indicating that these domains are not present for the purpose of forming prions. Indeed, prion-forming ability is not conserved, even within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the rare formation of prions is a disease. The prion domain sequences generally vary more rapidly in evolution than does the remainder of the molecule, producing a barrier to prion transmission, perhaps selected in evolution by this protection.},

The yeast prions are protein-based heritable elements, such as [PSI(+)], in which aggregates of prion proteins are transmitted to daughter cells in a non-Mendelian manner. Although the genetic approaches preceded the yeast prion studies, recent investigations of the dynamic aspects of the prion proteins have unraveled the molecular mechanisms by which prions are propagated and transmitted. In particular, several lines of evidence have revealed that the oligomeric species of prion proteins dispersed in the cytoplasm are critical for the transmission.

abstract = {It is assumed that protein fibrils manifested in amyloidosis result from an aggregation reaction involving small misfolded protein sequences being in an 'oligomeric' or 'prefibrillar' state. This review covers recent optical spectroscopic studies of amyloid protein misfolding, oligomerization and amyloid fibril growth. Although amyloid fibrils have been studied using established protein-characterization techniques throughout the years, their oligomeric precursor states require sensitive detection in real-time. Here, fluorescent staining is commonly performed using thioflavin T and other small fluorescent molecules such as 4-(dicyanovinyl)- julolidine and 1-amino-8-naphtalene sulphonate that have high affinity to hydrophobic patches. Thus, populated oligomeric intermediates and related 'prefibrillar structures' have been reported for several human amyloidogenic systems, including amyloid-beta protein, prion protein, transthyretin, alpha-synuclein, apolipoprotein C-II and insulin. To obtain information on the progression of the intermediate states, these were monitored in terms of fluorescence parameters, such as anisotropy, and quantum efficiency changes upon protein binding. Recently, new antibody stains have allowed precise monitoring of the oligomer size and distributions using multicolor labelling and single molecule detection. Moreover, a pentameric thiophene derivative (p-FTAA) was reported to indicate early precursors during A-beta(1-40) fibrillation, and was also demonstrated in real-time visualization of cerebral protein aggregates in transgenic AD mouse models by multiphoton microscopy. Conclusively, molecular probes and optical spectroscopy are now entering a phase enabling the in vivo interrogation of the role of oligomers in amyloidosis. Such techniques used in parallel with in vitro experiments, of increasing detail, will probably couple structure to pathogenesis in the near future.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are filamentous protein aggregates that accumulate in diseases such as Alzheimer's or type II diabetes. The amyloid-forming protein is disease specific. Amyloids may also be formed in vitro from many other proteins, after first denaturing them. Unlike the diverse native folds of these proteins, their amyloids are fundamentally similar in being rigid, smooth-sided, and cross-beta-structured, that is, with beta strands running perpendicular to the fibril axis. In the absence of high-resolution fibril structures, increasingly credible models are being derived by integrating data from a crossfire of experimental techniques. Most current models of disease-related amyloids invoke "beta arcades," columnar structures produced by in-register stacking of "beta arches." A beta arch is a strand-turn-strand motif in which the two beta strands interact via their side chains, not via the polypeptide backbone as in a conventional beta hairpin. Crystal structures of beta-solenoids, a class of proteins with amyloid-like properties, offer insight into the beta-arc turns found in beta arches. General conformational and thermodynamic considerations suggest that complexes of 2 or more beta arches may nucleate amyloid fibrillogenesis in vivo. The apparent prevalence of beta arches and their components have implications for identifying amyloidogenic sequences, elucidating fibril polymorphisms, predicting the locations and conformations of beta arcs within amyloid fibrils, and refining existing fibril models.},

abstract = {Structural information regarding normal prion protein (PrP(C)) and the scrapie isoform (PrP(Sc)) is of vital importance for elucidating the pathogenesis of prion diseases (PDs). Despite successful determination of the three-dimensional structures of PrP(C), the structural details of PrP(Sc) remain elusive. Nevertheless, accumulated evidence indicates that beta-sheets comprise the basic building blocks of PrP(Sc). Consensus has been reached about the beta-sheet constitution of the N-terminus of PrP, but the constitution of C-terminal beta-sheets is heavily debated. By evaluating the most recent observations regarding the dynamics and structures of PrP, we propose that helix 2 is more likely than helices 1 and 3 to participate in beta-sheet formation. This hypothesis also provides clues to explaining an intriguing phenomenon in prion biology-the lack of PDs in non-mammals.},

abstract = {Prions are fascinating but often misunderstood protein aggregation phenomena. The traditional association of the mammalian prion protein with disease has overshadowed a potentially more interesting attribute of prions: their ability to create protein-based molecular memories. In fungi, prions alter the relationship between genotype and phenotype in a heritable way that diversifies clonal populations. Recent findings in yeast indicate that prions might be much more common than previously realized. Moreover, prion-driven phenotypic diversity increases under stress, and can be amplified by the dynamic maturation of prion-initiating states. In this article, we suggest that these qualities allow prions to act as 'bet-hedging' devices that facilitate the adaptation of yeasts to stressful environments, and might speed the evolution of new traits.},

abstract = {Errors occur randomly and at low frequency during the translation of mRNA. However, such errors may also be programmed by the sequence and structure of the mRNA. These programmed events are called 'recoding' and are found mostly in viruses, in which they are usually essential for viral replication. Translational errors at a stop codon may also be induced by drugs, raising the possibility of developing new treatment protocols for genetic diseases on the basis of nonsense mutations. Many studies have been carried out, but the molecular mechanisms governing these events remain largely unknown. Studies on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have contributed to characterization of the HIV-1 frameshifting site and have demonstrated that frameshifting is conserved from yeast to humans. Yeast has also proved a particularly useful model organism for deciphering the mechanisms of translation termination in eukaryotes and identifying the factors required to obtain a high level of natural suppression. These findings open up new possibilities for large-scale screening in yeast to identify new drugs for blocking HIV replication by inhibiting frameshifting or restoring production of the full-length protein from a gene inactivated by a premature termination codon. We explore these two aspects of the contribution of yeast studies to human medicine in this review.},

However, a summary of research indicates that polyQ repeats are inherently both toxic and functional at the same time. PolyQ motifs occur in proteins involved in gene expression and promote nuclear assemblies such as the transcription initiation complex. Transition of these functional complexes to insoluble protein aggregates is constitutively prevented by proteasomal proteolysis. Thus, conditions that exhaust the ubiquitin-proteasome system, such as the extensive production of expanded polyQ proteins, aging and xenobiotic stress, induce a congested state in which nuclear proteins, including those with polyQ stretches, form amyloid-like aggregates. Because protein aggregation is preceded by a series of protein misfolding steps termed polyQ fibrillation, the characterization of distinct fibrillation steps correlating with nuclear function and identification of the respective genetic modifiers is essential for understanding both the biology and pathology of polyQ. Thus, the comprehension of the physiological role of polyQ repeats is a prerequisite for uncovering the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative aggregation diseases.},

abstract = {Amyloidogenesis defines a condition in which a soluble and innocuous protein turns to insoluble protein aggregates known as amyloid fibrils. This protein suprastructure derived via chemically specific molecular self-assembly process has been commonly observed in various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Prion diseases. Although the major culprit for the cellular degeneration in the diseases remains unsettled, amyloidogenesis is considered to be etiologically involved. Recent recognition of fibrillar polymorphism observed mostly from in vitro amyloidogeneses may indicate that multiple mechanisms for the amyloid fibril formation would be operated. Nucleation-dependent fibrillation is the prevalent model for assessing the self-assembly process. Following thermodynamically unfavorable seed formation, monomeric polypeptides bind to the seeds by exerting structural adjustments to the template, which leads to accelerated amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we propose another in vitro model of amyloidogenesis named double-concerted fibrillation. Here, two consecutive assembly processes of monomers and subsequent oligomeric species are responsible for the amyloid fibril formation of alpha-synuclein, a pathological component of Parkinson's disease, following structural rearrangement within the oligomers which then act as a growing unit for the fibrillation.

abstract = {In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, the infectious material consists chiefly of a protein, the scrapie prion protein PrP(Sc), that carries no genetic coding material; however, prions are likely to have accomplices that chaperone their activity and promote the conversion of the cellular prion protein PrP(C) into the disease-causing isoform (PrP(Sc)). Recent studies from several laboratories indicate that PrP(C) recognizes many nucleic acids (NAs) with high affinities, and we correlate these findings with a possible pathophysiological role for this interaction. Thus, of the chaperones, NA is the most likely candidate for prions. The participation of NAs in prion propagation opens new avenues for developing new diagnostic tools and therapeutics to target prion diseases, as well as for understanding the function of PrP(C), probably as a NA chaperone.},

abstract = {Among the different cellular surveillance mechanisms in charge to prevent production of faulty gene products, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) represents a translation-dependent posttranscriptional process that selectively recognizes and degrades mRNAs whose open reading frame (ORF) is truncated by a premature translation termination codon (PTC, also called "nonsense codon"). In doing so, NMD protects the cell from accumulating C-terminally truncated proteins with potentially deleterious functions. Transcriptome profiling of NMD-deficient yeast, Drosophila, and human cells revealed that 3-10{\%} of all mRNA levels are regulated (directly or indirectly) by NMD, indicating an important role of NMD in gene regulation that extends beyond quality control [J. Rehwinkel, J. Raes, E. Izaurralde, Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: Target genes and functional diversification of effectors, Trends Biochem. Sci. 31 (2006) 639-646.[1]].

abstract = {A short review of the results of molecular modeling of prion disease is presented in this chapter. According to the "one-protein theory" proposed by Prusiner, prion proteins are misfolded naturally occurring proteins, which, on interaction with correctly folded proteins may induce misfolding and propagate the disease, resulting in insoluble amyloid aggregates in cells of affected specimens. Because of experimental difficulties in measurements of origin and growth of insoluble amyloid aggregations in cells, theoretical modeling is often the only one source of information regarding the molecular mechanism of the disease. Replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations presented in this chapter indicate that proteins in the native state, N, on interaction with an energetically higher structure, R, can change their conformation into R and form a dimer, R(2). The addition of another protein in the N state to R(2) may lead to spontaneous formation of a trimer, R(3). These results reveal the molecular basis for a model of prion disease propagation or conformational diseases in general.},

However, attempts to readthrough PTCs in many diseases resulted in variable effects. Here, we focus on the efforts of such therapeutic approaches in cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy and discuss the factors contributing to successful readthrough and how the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway regulates this response. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis for variable response to readthrough of PTCs is necessary so that appropriate therapies can be developed to treat many human genetic diseases caused by PTCs.},

This involves a dramatic increase in beta sheet conformation as PrP(C) is converted to PrP(Sc), and it is widely believed that this conformational change affects the as-yet undefined function of PrP(C). Although there are many methods available to monitor for the changes in the structural makeup of PrP mutants and oligomers formed with respect to disease relevance, circular dichroism is one of the most popular methods used.

Disease-associated amyloid formation is the result of proteins that misfold and aggregate into beta sheet-rich fibre polymers. Cellular toxicity is readily associated with amyloidogenesis, although the molecular mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Recently, a new class of 'functional' amyloid fibres was discovered that demonstrates that amyloids can be utilized as a productive part of cellular biology. These functional amyloids will provide unique insights into how amyloid formation can be controlled and made less cytotoxic. Bacteria produce some of the best-characterized functional amyloids, including a surface amyloid fibre called curli. Assembled by enteric bacteria, curli fibres mediate attachment to surfaces and host tissues. Some bacterial amyloids, like harpins and microcinE492, have exploited amyloid toxicity in a directed and functional manner. Here, we review and discuss the functional amyloids assembled by bacteria. Special emphasis will be paid to the biology of functional amyloid synthesis and the connections between bacterial physiology and pathology.},

They are unique in terms of their biology because they are caused by the conformational re-arrangement of a normal host-encoded prion protein, PrPC, to an abnormal infectious isoform, PrPSc. Currently the precise mechanism behind prion-mediated neurodegeneration remains unclear. It is hypothesised than an unknown toxic gain of function of PrPSc, or an intermediate oligomeric form, underlies neuronal death. Increasing evidence suggests a role for the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in prion disease. Both wild-type PrPC and disease-associated PrP isoforms accumulate in cells after proteasome inhibition leading to increased cell death, and abnormal beta-sheet-rich PrP isoforms have been shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Here we review potential interactions between prions and the proteasome outlining how the UPS may be implicated in prion-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Abnormal protein aggregates, in the form of either extracellular plaques or intracellular inclusions, are an important pathological feature of the majority of neurodegenerative disorders. The major molecular constituents of these lesions, viz., beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau, and alpha-synuclein, have played a defining role in the diagnosis and classification of disease and in studies of pathogenesis. The molecular composition of a protein aggregate, however, is often complex and could be the direct or indirect consequence of a pathogenic gene mutation, be the result of cell degeneration, or reflect the acquisition of new substances by diffusion and molecular binding to existing proteins. This review examines the molecular composition of the major protein aggregates found in the neurodegenerative diseases including the Abeta and prion protein (PrP) plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion disease, respectively, and the cellular inclusions found in the tauopathies and synucleinopathies. The data suggest that the molecular constituents of a protein aggregate do not directly cause cell death but are largely the consequence of cell degeneration or are acquired during the disease process. These findings are discussed in relation to diagnosis and to studies of to disease pathogenesis.},

These include both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Rather than being a translation 'error', stop-codon readthrough can have important effects on other cellular processes such as mRNA degradation and, in some cases, can confer a beneficial phenotype to the cell.},

In addition to traditional nucleic acid-based genetic determinants, unique proteins known as prions can also act as elements of inheritance, infectivity, and disease. Nucleic acids and proteins encode genetic information in distinct ways, either in the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA or in the three dimensional structure of the polypeptide chain. Given these differences in the nature of the genetic repository, the mechanisms underlying the transmission of nucleic acid-based and protein-based phenotypes are necessarily distinct. While the appearance, persistence and transfer of nucleic acid determinants require the synthesis of new polymers, recent studies indicate that prions are propagated through dynamic transitions in the structure of existing protein.},

Their unique biology, allied with the public-health risks posed by prion zoonoses such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has focused much attention on the molecular basis of prion propagation and the "species barrier" that controls cross-species transmission. Both are intimately linked to understanding how multiple prion "strains" are encoded by a protein-only agent. The underlying mechanisms are clearly of much wider importance, and analogous protein-based inheritance mechanisms are recognized in yeast and fungi. Recent advances suggest that prions themselves are not directly neurotoxic, but rather their propagation involves production of toxic species, which may be uncoupled from infectivity.},

Cells have evolved mechanisms for rescuing and recycling misfolded proteins, but these systems are not perfect. Chaperones can rescue misfolded proteins by breaking up aggregates and assisting in the refolding process. Proteins that cannot be rescued by refolding can be delivered to the proteasome by chaperones to be recycled. One class of 'misfolded' proteins, prions, appears to evade detection by this machinery and persist in a misfolded state. In fact, it seems that the prions usurp the refolding machinery and actually employ chaperones to propagate the prion state.

abstract = {C. elegans represents a favorable system to study the extraordinarily complicated process of eukaryotic protein synthesis, which involves over 100 RNAs and over 200 polypeptides just for the core machinery. Initial research in protein synthesis relied on fractionated mammalian and plant systems, but in the mid-1970s, the powerful genetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae began to yield new insights for translation in all eukaryotes. C. elegans has many features of higher eukaryotes that are not shared by yeast. This allows protein synthesis researchers to combine biochemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, genetics, and genomics to study regulation of gene expression at the translational level. Most components of the core translational machinery have been identified in C. elegans, including rRNAs, 5S RNA, tRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. C. elegans has amino acid sequence homologs for 56 of the known initiation, elongation, and release factor polypeptides, but few of these have been isolated, functionally identified, or studied at the biochemical level. Similarly, C. elegans has homologs for 22 components of the major signal transduction pathways implicated in control of protein synthesis. The translational efficiency of individual mRNAs relies on cis-regulatory elements that include either a 7-methylguanosine- or 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine-containing cap, the 5'-terminal spliced leader, sequence elements in the 3'-untranslated regions, and the 3'-terminal poly(A) tract. Several key developmental pathways in C. elegans are predominantly governed by translational mechanisms. Some evidence has been presented that well described regulatory mechanisms in other organisms, including covalent modification of translation factors, sequestration of translation factors, and mRNA-specific changes in poly(A) length, also occur in C. elegans. The most interesting unexplored questions may involve changes in the translation of individual mRNAs during development, in response to physiological changes, or after genetic manipulations. Given the highly developed state of C. elegans genomics, it can be expected that future application of computational tools, including data visualization, will help detect new instances of translational control.},

abstract = {Infectious proteins (prions) became an important medical issue when they were identified as agents of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. More recently, prions have been found in fungi and their investigation has been facilitated by greater experimental tractability. In each case, the normal form of the prion protein may be converted into the infectious form (the prion itself) in an autocatalytic process; conversion may either occur spontaneously or by transmission from an already infected cell. Four fungal prion proteins have been studied in some depth-Ure2p, Sup35p, and Rnq1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and HET-s of Podospora anserina. Each has a "prion domain" that governs infectivity and a "functional domain" that contributes the protein's activity in a wild-type cell, if it has one. This activity is repressed in prion-infected cells for loss-of-activity prions, [URE3] (the prion of Ure2p) and [PSI] (the prion of Sup35p). For gain-of-activity prions, [PIN] (the prion of Rnq1p) and [Het-s] (the prion of HET-s), the prion domain is also involved in generating a new activity in infected cells. In prion conversion, prion domains polymerize into an amyloid filament, switching from a "natively unfolded" conformation into an amyloid conformation (stable, protease-resistant, rich in cross-beta structure). For Ure2p and probably also Sup35p, the functional domain retains its globular fold but is inactivated by a steric mechanism. We review the evidence on which this scenario is based with emphasis on filament structure, summarizing current experimental constraints and appraising proposed models. We conclude that the parallel superpleated beta-structure and a specific beta-helical formulation are valid candidates while other proposals are excluded. In both the Ure2p and Sup35p systems, prion domain amyloid filaments exhibit polymorphic variation. However, once a certain structure is nucleated, it is maintained throughout that filament. Electron microscopy of several Ure2p-related constructs indicates that the basis for polymorphism lies mainly if not entirely in the prion domain. Filament polymorphism appears to underlie the phenomenon of prion "variants" which differ in the severity of their phenotype, that is, for Ure2p and Sup35p, the stringency with which their activity is switched off. We discuss a possible structural basis for this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Prion diseases form a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals. All of which are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), denoted PrP(Sc), which is the major component of infectious prion diseases. The function of PrP(C) remains elusive. Its amino-terminal region contains a repeated five octapeptide domain that binds copper. The protein is believed to display a superoxide dismutase like activity, and hence a possible protective function against oxidative stress. In this review, relationship between PrP, copper and oxidative stress was analysed. Thus, metal ions and oxidative stress would play an essential role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and represent important targets for future therapeutic targets or a novel diagnostic marker.},

Considerable evidence suggests that the infectious agent is an abnormally folded protein that promotes or seeds its normal cellular isoform to fold into the infectious form. However, the precise mechanism and factors involved in this conversion remain unknown. A major stumbling block to further investigation has been the inability to seed the formation of new infectious material in vitro. Now, however, infectious material has been generated in a cell-free system. Although this system uses cell lysate rather than pure proteins, it nevertheless opens the door to the elucidation of targets of intervention and the development of useful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), or prion diseases are a group of transmissible neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals. Although the infectious agent (the 'prion') has not yet been formally defined at the molecular level, much evidence exists to suggest that the major or sole component is an abnormal isoform of the host encoded prion protein (PrP). Different strains or isolates of the infectious agent exist, which exhibit characteristic disease phenotypes when transmitted to susceptible animals. In the absence of a nucleic acid genome it has been hard to accommodate the existence of TSE strains within the protein-only model of prion replication. Recent work examining the conformation and glycosylation patterns of disease-associated PrP has shown that these post-translational modifications show strain-specific properties and contribute to the molecular basis of TSE strain variation. This article will review the role of glycosylation in the susceptibility of cellular PrP to conversion to the disease-associated conformation and the role of glycosylation as a marker of TSE strain type.},

abstract = {Newly made polypeptide chains require the help of molecular chaperones not only to rapidly reach their final three-dimensional forms, but also to unfold and then correctly refold them back to their biologically active form should they misfold. Most prions are an unusual type of protein that can exist in one of two stable conformations, one of which leads to formation of an infectious alternatively folded form. Studies in Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have revealed that prions can exploit the molecular chaperone machinery in the cell in order to ensure stable propagation of the infectious, aggregation-prone form. The disaggregation of yeast prion aggregates by molecular chaperones generates forms of the prion protein that can seed the protein polymerisation that underlies the prion propagation cycle. In this article, we review what we have learnt about the role of molecular chaperones in yeast prion propagation, describe a model that can explain the role of various classes of molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones, and speculate on the possible involvement of chaperones in the propagation of mammalian prions.},

The most famous example is the use of reeled silkworm silk from Bombyx mori to produce textiles. In contrast, despite the more promising properties of their silk, spiders have not been domesticated for large-scale or even industrial applications, since farming the spiders is not commercially viable due to their highly territorial and cannibalistic nature. Before spider silks can be copied or mimicked, not only the sequence of the underlying proteins but also their functions have to be resolved. Several attempts to recombinantly produce spider silks or spider silk mimics in various expression hosts have been reported previously. A new protein engineering approach, which combines synthetic repetitive silk sequences with authentic silk domains, reveals proteins that closely resemble silk proteins and that can be produced at high yields, which provides a basis for cost-efficient large scale production of spider silk-like proteins.},

abstract = {The normal function of prion protein (PrP) is usually disregarded at the expense of the more fascinating role of PrP in transmissible prion diseases. However, the normal PrP may play an important role in cellular function in the central nervous system, since PrP is highly expressed in neurons and motifs in the sequence of PrP are conserved in evolution. The finding that prion null mice do not have a significant overt phenotype suggests that the normal function of PrP is of minor importance. However, the absence of PrP in cells or in vivo contributes to an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress or apoptosis-inducing insults. An alternative explanation is that the PrP normal function is so important that it is redundant. Probing into the characteristics of PrP has revealed a number of features that could mediate important cellular functions. The neuroprotective actions so far identified with PrP are initiated through cell surface signaling, antioxidant activity, or anti-Bax function. Here, we review the characteristics of the PrP and the evidence that PrP protects against neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death.},

Recent analyses suggest decapping of an mRNA consists of four central and related events. These include removal, or inactivation, of the poly(A) tail as an inhibitor of decapping, exit from active translation, assembly of a decapping complex on the mRNA, and sequestration of the mRNA into discrete cytoplasmic foci where decapping can occur. Each of these steps is a demonstrated, or potential, site for the regulation of mRNA decay. We discuss the decapping process in the light of these central properties, which also suggest fundamental aspects of cytoplasmic mRNA physiology that connect decapping, translation, and storage of mRNA.},

abstract = {The prion hypothesis proposes that proteins can act as infectious agents. Originally formulated to explain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), the prion hypothesis has been extended with the finding that several non-Mendelian traits in fungi are due to heritable changes in protein conformation, which may in some cases be beneficial. Although much remains to be learned about the specific role of cellular cofactors, mechanistic parallels between the mammalian and yeast prion phenomena point to universal features of conformation-based infection and inheritance involving propagation of ordered beta-sheet-rich protein aggregates commonly referred to as amyloid. Here we focus on two such features and discuss recent efforts to explain them in terms of the physical properties of amyloid-like aggregates. The first is prion strains, wherein chemically identical infectious particles cause distinct phenotypes. The second is barriers that often prohibit prion transmission between different species. There is increasing evidence suggesting that both of these can be manifestations of the same phenomenon: the ability of a protein to misfold into multiple self-propagating conformations. Even single mutations can change the spectrum of favored misfolded conformations. In turn, changes in amyloid conformation can shift the specificity of propagation and alter strain phenotypes. This model helps explain many common and otherwise puzzling features of prion inheritance as well as aspects of noninfectious diseases involving toxic misfolded proteins.},

Then, iatrogenic transmission of prions caused more than 250 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. More recently, transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to humans caused a widespread health scare. On the other hand, the biology of prions represents a fascinating and poorly understood phenomenon, which may account for more than just diseases and may represent a fundamental mechanism of crosstalk between proteins. The two decades since Stanley Prusiner's formulation of the protein-only hypothesis have witnessed spectacular advances, and yet some of the most basic questions in prion science have remained unanswered.},

All these mechanisms of immunointervention have been successfully used to prevent and sometimes treat experimental models of autoimmune diseases. Based on these results, expectations have been raised for exploiting similar strategies to inhibit pathogenic autoreactive T cells in human autoimmune diseases. Among them, mucosal administration of autoantigen is an attractive mode of immunointervention still awaiting demonstration of clinical efficacy in human autoimmune diseases. A further step in this direction is now provided by the clear-cut immune deviation observed following oral administration of a disease-related peptide to rheumatoid arthritis patients, leading to inhibition of Th1 while enhancing Th2 and possibly Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells.},

Errors can arise by multiple mechanisms, such as altered start site selection, reading frame shifts, misincorporation or nonsense codon suppression. All of these events produce incorrect protein products. Translational accuracy is affected by both cis- and trans-acting elements that insure the proper peptide is synthesized by the protein synthetic machinery. Many cellular components are involved in the accuracy of translation, including RNAs (transfer RNAs, messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs) and proteins (ribosomal proteins and translation factors). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven an ideal system to study translational fidelity by integrating genetic approaches with biochemical analysis. This review focuses on the ways studies in yeast have contributed to our understanding of the roles translation factors and the ribosome play in assuring the accuracy of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {The proportion of the genome encoding intrinsically unstructured proteins increases with the complexity of organisms, which demands specific mechanism(s) for generating novel genetic material of this sort. Here it is suggested that one such mechanism is the expansion of internal repeat regions, i.e., coding micro- and minisatellites. An analysis of 126 known unstructured sequences shows the preponderance of repeats: the percentage of proteins with tandemly repeated short segments is much higher in this class (39{\%}) than earlier reported for all Swiss-Prot (14{\%}), yeast (18{\%}) or human (28{\%}) proteins. Furthermore, prime examples, such as salivary proline-rich proteins, titin, eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, the prion protein and several others, demonstrate that the repetitive segments carry fundamental function in these proteins. In addition, their repeat numbers show functionally significant interspecies variation and polymorphism, which underlines that these regions have been shaped by intense evolutionary activity. In all, the major point of this paper is that the genetic instability of repetitive regions combined with the structurally and functionally permissive nature of unstructured proteins has powered the extension and possible functional expansion of this newly recognized protein class.},

@article{Stefani2003,
abstract = {The deposition of proteins in the form of amyloid fibrils and plaques is the characteristic feature of more than 20 degenerative conditions affecting either the central nervous system or a variety of peripheral tissues. As these conditions include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and the prion diseases, several forms of fatal systemic amyloidosis, and at least one condition associated with medical intervention (haemodialysis), they are of enormous importance in the context of present-day human health and welfare. Much remains to be learned about the mechanism by which the proteins associated with these diseases aggregate and form amyloid structures, and how the latter affect the functions of the organs with which they are associated. A great deal of information concerning these diseases has emerged, however, during the past 5 years, much of it causing a number of fundamental assumptions about the amyloid diseases to be re-examined. For example, it is now apparent that the ability to form amyloid structures is not an unusual feature of the small number of proteins associated with these diseases but is instead a general property of polypeptide chains. It has also been found recently that aggregates of proteins not associated with amyloid diseases can impair the ability of cells to function to a similar extent as aggregates of proteins linked with specific neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the mature amyloid fibrils or plaques appear to be substantially less toxic than the pre-fibrillar aggregates that are their precursors. The toxicity of these early aggregates appears to result from an intrinsic ability to impair fundamental cellular processes by interacting with cellular membranes, causing oxidative stress and increases in free Ca2+ that eventually lead to apoptotic or necrotic cell death. The 'new view' of these diseases also suggests that other degenerative conditions could have similar underlying origins to those of the amyloidoses. In addition, cellular protection mechanisms, such as molecular chaperones and the protein degradation machinery, appear to be crucial in the prevention of disease in normally functioning living organisms. It also suggests some intriguing new factors that could be of great significance in the evolution of biological molecules and the mechanisms that regulate their behaviour.},

Antibiotics such as streptomycin and paromomycin have long been known to increase the error rate of translation, and many mutations that increase or lower accuracy have been characterized. Recent crystal structures show that the specific recognition of base-pairing geometry leads to a closure of the domains of the small subunit around cognate tRNA. This domain closure is likely to trigger subsequent steps in tRNA selection. Many antibiotics and mutations act by making the domain closure more or less favourable. In conjunction with recent cryoelectron microscopy structures of the ribosome, a comprehensive structural understanding of the decoding process is beginning to emerge.},

However, the suggested structural mimicry of RF2 is not in agreement with the tripeptide 'anticodon' hypothesis and, furthermore, recently determined structures using cryo-electron microscopy show that, when bound to the ribosome, RF2 has a conformation that is distinct from the RF2 crystal structure. In addition, hydroxyl-radical probings of RRF on the ribosome are not in agreement with the simple idea that RRF mimics tRNA in the ribosome A-site. All of this evidence seriously questions the simple concept of structural mimicry between proteins and RNA and, thus, leaves only functional mimicry of protein factors of translation to be investigated.},

abstract = {In most cases, translational control mechanisms result from the interaction of RNA-binding proteins with 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA. In organisms ranging from viruses to humans, protein-mediated interactions between transcript termini result in the formation of an RNA loop. Such RNA 'circularization' is thought to increase translational efficiency and, in addition, permits regulation by novel mechanisms, particularly 3'-UTR-mediated translational control. Two general mechanisms of translational inhibition by 3'-UTR-binding proteins have been proposed, one in which mRNA closure is disrupted and another in which mRNA closure is required. Experimental evidence for the latter is provided by studies of interferon-gamma-mediated translational silencing of ceruloplasmin expression in monocytic cells. A multi-species analysis has shown that, in most vertebrates, 3'-UTRs are substantially longer than their 5' counterparts, indicating a significant potential for regulation. In addition, the average length of 3'-UTR sequences has increased during evolution, suggesting that their utilization might contribute to organism complexity.},

abstract = {Following intracerebral or peripheral inoculation of mice with scrapie prions, infectivity accumulates first in the spleen and only later in the brain. In the spleen of scrapie-infected mice, prions were found in association with T and B lymphocytes and to a somewhat lesser degree with the stroma, which contains the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) but not with non-B, non-T cells; strikingly, no infectivity was found in lymphocytes from blood of the same mice. Transgenic PrP knockout mice expressing PrP restricted to either B or T lymphocytes show no prion replication in the lymphoreticular system. Therefore, splenic lymphocytes either acquire prions from another source or replicate them in dependency on other PrP-expressing cells. The essential role of FDCs in prion replication in spleen was shown by treating mice with soluble lymphotoxin-beta receptor, which led to disappearance of mature FDCs from the spleen and concomitantly abolished splenic prion accumulation and retarded neuroinvasion following intraperitoneal scrapie inoculation.},

abstract = {At the present time, protein folding is an extremely active field of research including aspects of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science and physics. The fundamental principles have practical applications in the exploitation of the advances in genome research, in the understanding of different pathologies and in the design of novel proteins with special functions. Although the detailed mechanisms of folding are not completely known, significant advances have been made in the understanding of this complex process through both experimental and theoretical approaches. In this review, the evolution of concepts from Anfinsen's postulate to the "new view" emphasizing the concept of the energy landscape of folding is presented. The main rules of protein folding have been established from in vitro experiments. It has been long accepted that the in vitro refolding process is a good model for understanding the mechanisms by which a nascent polypeptide chain reaches its native conformation in the cellular environment. Indeed, many denatured proteins, even those whose disulfide bridges have been disrupted, are able to refold spontaneously. Although this assumption was challenged by the discovery of molecular chaperones, from the amount of both structural and functional information now available, it has been clearly established that the main rules of protein folding deduced from in vitro experiments are also valid in the cellular environment. This modern view of protein folding permits a better understanding of the aggregation processes that play a role in several pathologies, including those induced by prions and Alzheimer's disease. Drug design and de novo protein design with the aim of creating proteins with novel functions by application of protein folding rules are making significant progress and offer perspectives for practical applications in the development of pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics.},

SCA1 has the intriguing feature that the disease-causing mutation is the expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat, specifically a CAG repeat that encodes the amino acid glutamine in ataxin-1. During the past 10 years, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the pathogenic mechanism in this disease. The nucleus has been identified as the subcellular site where the mutant protein acts to cause disease. Evidence indicates that expansion of the glutamine tract alters the folding properties of ataxin-1. Finally, several cellular pathways have been identified which are able to impinge on the SCA1 disease process. The characterization of these pathways and their role in SCA1 will guide research over the next several years.},

The stability of a particular mRNA is controlled by specific interactions between its structural elements and RNA-binding proteins that can be general or mRNA-specific. Regulated mRNA stability is achieved through fluctuations in half-lives in response to developmental or environmental stimuli like nutrient levels, cytokines, hormones and temperature shifts as well as environmental stresses like hypoxia, hypocalcemia, viral infection, and tissue injury. Furthermore, in specific disorders like some forms of neoplasia, thalassemia and Alzheimer's disease, deregulated mRNA stability can lead to the aberrant accumulation of mRNAs and the proteins they encode. This review presents a discussion of some recently identified examples of regulated and deregulated mRNA stability in order to illustrate the diversity of genes regulated by alterations in the degradation rates of their mRNAs.},

@article{Chernoff2001,
abstract = {The experimental evidence accumulated for the last half of the century clearly suggests that inherited variation is not restricted to the changes in genomic sequences. The prion model, originally based on unusual transmission of certain neurodegenerative diseases in mammals, provides a molecular mechanism for the template-like reproduction of alternative protein conformations. Recent data extend this model to protein-based genetic elements in yeast and other fungi. Reproduction and transmission of yeast protein-based genetic elements is controlled by the "prion replication" machinery of the cell, composed of the protein helpers responsible for the processes of assembly and disassembly of protein structures and multiprotein complexes. Among these, the stress-related chaperones of Hsp100 and Hsp70 groups play an important role. Alterations of levels or activity of these proteins result in "mutator" or "antimutator" affects in regard to protein-based genetic elements. "Protein mutagens" have also been identified that affect formation and/or propagation of the alternative protein conformations. Prion-forming abilities appear to be conserved in evolution, despite the divergence of the corresponding amino acid sequences. Moreover, a wide variety of proteins of different origins appear to possess the ability to form amyloid-like aggregates, that in certain conditions might potentially result in prion-like switches. This suggests a possible mechanism for the inheritance of acquired traits, postulated in the Lamarckian theory of evolution. The prion model also puts in doubt the notion that cloned animals are genetically identical to their genome donors, and suggests that genome sequence would not provide a complete information about the genetic makeup of an organism.},

@article{Meyuhas2000,
abstract = {The synthesis of many mammalian proteins associated with the translational apparatus is selectively regulated by mitogenic and nutritional stimuli, at the translational level. The apparent advantages of the regulation of gene expression at the translational level are the speed and the readily reversible nature of the response to altering physiological conditions. These two features enable cells to rapidly repress the biosynthesis of the translational machinery upon shortage of amino acids or growth arrest, thus rapidly blocking unnecessary energy wastage. Likewise, when amino acids are replenished or mitogenic stimulation is applied, then cells can rapidly respond in resuming the costly biosynthesis of the translational apparatus. A structural hallmark, common to mRNAs encoding many components of the translational machinery, is the presence of a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5'TOP), referred to as TOP mRNAs. This structural motif comprises the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of these mRNAs. The present review focuses on the mechanism underlying the translational control of TOP mRNAs upon growth and nutritional stimuli. A special emphasis is put on the pivotal role played by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in this mode of regulation, and the upstream regulatory pathways, which might be engaged in transducing external signals into activation of S6K. Finally, the possible involvement of pyrimidine-binding proteins in the translational control of TOP mRNAs is discussed.},

abstract = {In the past years, the attention of scientists has focused mainly on the study of the genetic information and alterations that regulate eukaryotic cell proliferation and that lead to neoplastic transformation. All therapeutic strategies against cancer are, to date, directed at DNA either with cytotoxic drugs or gene therapy. Little or no interest has been aroused by protein synthesis mechanisms. However, an increasing body of data is emerging about the involvement of translational processes and factors in control of cell proliferation, indicating that protein synthesis can be an additional target for anticancer strategies. In this paper we review the novel insights on the biochemical and molecular events leading to protein biosynthesis and we describe their involvement in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. A possible mechanistic explanation is given by the interactions that occur between protein synthesis machinery and the proliferative signal transduction pathways and that are therefore suitable targets for indirect modulation of protein synthesis. We briefly describe the molecular tools used to block protein synthesis and the attempts made at increasing their efficacy. Finally, we propose a new multimodal strategy against cancer based on the simultaneous intervention on protein synthesis and signal transduction.},

The majority of studies to date have focused on transcriptional control mechanisms, but the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes is becoming increasingly clear. In this short review, selected examples of post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms operating in both lower and higher eukaryotes will be used to highlight the plethora of such mechanisms already identified. The underlying theme is that post-transcriptional gene regulation relies on specific RNA-protein interactions that either result in the targeted degradation of the mRNA or prevent access of the ribosome to the translation start codon. Such interactions can occur in the 5' or 3' untranslated regions of an mRNA or within the decoded portion of the molecule. The importance of these regulatory mechanisms in a range of biological systems is also illustrated.},

abstract = {Prions are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of invariably fatal, neurodegenerative diseases by an entirely novel mechanism. Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion protein (PrP). The human prion disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) generally presents as a progressive dementia, whereas scrapie of sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are manifest as ataxic illnesses. Prions are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified isoform of PrP designated PrPSc. The normal, cellular PrP designated PrPC is converted into PrPSc through a process whereby some of its alpha-helical structure is converted into beta-sheet. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence of the chromosomal PrP gene of the mammals in which it last replicated. In contrast to pathogens with a nucleic acid genome, prions encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of PrPSc. Transgenetic studies argue that PrPSc acts as a template upon which PrPC is refolded into a nascent PrPSc molecule through a process facilitated by another protein.},

Translation can also be regulated by short open reading frames within the 5' -untranslated region. A key factor for initiation is elF4F, in which one of the polypeptide chains, elF4G, seems to have a bridging function and binds three other factors at separate sites: elF4E (the cap-binding factor), the helicase elF4A, and elF3, which also interacts with 40S ribosomal subunits. Initiation is regulated by the MAP kinase and rapamycin-sensitive signalling pathways, which control phosphorylation of elF4E and 4E-BP1, a protein which in the dephosphorylated form binds and sequesters elF4E.},

abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process that provides cells with the molecular factories for cellular protein production. Accordingly, its misregulation lies at the heart of several hereditary diseases (e.g., Diamond-Blackfan anemia). The process of ribosome assembly comprises the processing and folding of the pre-rRNA and its concomitant assembly with the ribosomal proteins. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis relies on a large number (>200) of non-ribosomal factors, which confer directionality and accuracy to this process. Many of these non-ribosomal factors fall into different families of energy-consuming enzymes, notably including ATP-dependent RNA helicases, AAA-ATPases, GTPases, and kinases. Ribosome biogenesis is highly conserved within eukaryotic organisms; however, due to the combination of powerful genetic and biochemical methods, it is best studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This review summarizes our current knowledge on eukaryotic ribosome assembly, with particular focus on the molecular role of the involved energy-consuming enzymes.},

abstract = {The molecular chaperone Hsp104 plays a central role in the clearance of aggregates after heat shock and the propagation of yeast prions. Hsp104's disaggregation activity and prion propagation have been linked to its ability to resolubilize or remodel protein aggregates. However, Hsp104 has also the capacity to catalyze protein aggregation of some substrates at specific conditions. Hence, it is a molecular chaperone with two opposing activities with respect to protein aggregation. In yeast models of Huntington's disease, Hsp104 is required for the aggregation and toxicity of polyglutamine (polyQ), but the expression of Hsp104 in cellular and animal models of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease protects against polyQ and alpha-synuclein toxicity. Therefore, elucidating the molecular determinants and mechanisms underlying the ability of Hsp104 to switch between these two activities is of critical importance for understanding its function and could provide insight into novel strategies aimed at preventing or reversing the formation of toxic protein aggregation in systemic and neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases. Here, we present an overview of the current molecular models and hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the role of Hsp104 in modulating protein aggregation and prion propagation. The experimental approaches and the evidences presented so far in relation to these models are examined. Our primary objective is to offer a critical review that will inspire the use of novel techniques and the design of new experiments to proceed towards a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multifunctional properties of Hsp104 in vivo.},

abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) hold a central place in protein synthesis by interpreting the genetic information stored in DNA into the amino acid sequence of protein, thus functioning as "adaptor" molecules. In recent years, however, various studies have shown that tRNAs have additional functions beyond participating in protein synthesis. When suffering from certain nutritional stresses, tRNAs change the level of aminoacylation to became uncharged, and these uncharged tRNAs act as effector molecules to regulate global gene expression, so that the stressed organism copes with the adverse environmental stresses. In budding yeast and certain mammalian cells, the retrograde movement of mature tRNAs from cytoplasm to nucleus serves as a mechanism for the surveillance system within the nucleus to continue monitoring the integrity of tRNAs. On the other hand, this retrograde action effectively reduces the global protein synthesis level under conditions of nutritional starvation. Quite recently, various publications have shown that tRNAs are not stable molecules in an absolute sense. Under certain physiological or environmental stresses, they are specifically cleaved into fragments of different lengths in the anticodon loop or anticodon left arm. These cleavages are not a meaningless random degradation phenomenon. Instead, a novel class of signal molecules such as tRNA halves or sitRNAs may be produced, which are closely correlated with the modulation of global gene expression. Investigation of the regulatory functions of tRNAs is a frontier, which seeks to reveal the structural and functional diversity of tRNAs as well as their vital functions during the expression of genetic information.},

abstract = {The prion (infectious protein) concept has evolved with the discovery of new self-propagating protein states in organisms as diverse as mammals and fungi. The infectious agent of the mammalian transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) has long been considered the prototypical prion, and recent cell-free propagation and biophysical analyses of TSE infectivity have now firmly established its prion credentials. Other disease-associated protein aggregates, such as some amyloids, can also have prion-like characteristics under certain experimental conditions. However, most amyloids appear to lack the natural transmissibility of TSE prions. One feature that distinguishes the latter from the former is the glycophosphatidylinositol membrane anchor on prion protein, the molecule that is corrupted in TSE diseases. The presence of this anchor profoundly affects TSE pathogenesis, which involves major membrane distortions in the brain, and may be a key reason for the greater neurovirulence of TSE prions relative to many other autocatalytic protein aggregates.},

RNA, DNA or peptide aptamers are classes of molecules which can be selected from complex combinatorial libraries for high affinity and specific binding to prion proteins and which might therefore be useful in diagnosis and therapy of prion diseases. Nucleic acid aptamers, which can be chemically synthesized, stabilized and immobilized, appear more suitable for diagnostic purposes, allowing use of PrP(Sc) as selection target. Peptide aptamers facilitate appropriate intracellular expression, targeting and re-routing without losing their binding properties to PrP, a requirement for potential therapeutic gene transfer experiments in vivo. Elucidation of structural properties of peptide aptamers might be used as basis for rational drug design, providing another attractive application of peptide aptamers in the search for effective anti-prion strategies.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are long, helically symmetric protein aggregates that can display substantial variation (polymorphism), including alterations in twist and structure at the beta-strand and protofilament levels, even when grown under the same experimental conditions. The structural and thermodynamic origins of this behavior are not yet understood. We performed molecular-dynamics simulations to determine the thermodynamic properties of different polymorphs of the peptide GNNQQNY, modeling fibrils containing different numbers of protofilaments based on the structure of amyloid-like cross-beta crystals of this peptide. We also modeled fibrils with new orientations of the side chains, as well as a de novo designed structure based on antiparallel beta-strands. The simulations show that these polymorphs are approximately isoenergetic under a range of conditions. Structural analysis reveals a dynamic reorganization of electrostatics and hydrogen bonding in the main and side chains of the Gln and Asn residues that characterize this peptide sequence. Q/N-rich stretches are found in several amyloidogenic proteins and peptides, including the yeast prions Sup35-N and Ure2p, as well as in the human poly-Q disease proteins, including the ataxins and huntingtin. Based on our results, we propose that these residues imbue a unique structural plasticity to the amyloid fibrils that they comprise, rationalizing the ability of proteins enriched in these amino acids to form prion strains with heritable and different phenotypic traits.},

abstract = {Prions represent an unusual structural form of a protein that is 'infectious'. In mammals, prions are associated with fatal neurodegenerative diseases such as CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), while in fungi they act as novel epigenetic regulators of phenotype. Even though most of the human prion diseases arise spontaneously, we still know remarkably little about how infectious prions form de novo. The [PSI+] prion of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a highly tractable model in which to explore the underlying mechanism of de novo prion formation, in particular identifying key cis- and trans-acting factors. Most significantly, the de novo formation of [PSI+] requires the presence of a second prion called [PIN+], which is typically the prion form of Rnq1p, a protein rich in glutamine and aspartic acid residues. The molecular mechanism by which the [PIN(+)] prion facilitates de novo [PSI+] formation is not fully established, but most probably involves some form of cross-seeding. A number of other cellular factors, in particular chaperones of the Hsp70 (heat-shock protein 70) family, are known to modify the frequency of de novo prion formation in yeast.},

In a recent study, a comparative analysis of the aggregation propensities of chimeric proteins derived from the yeast Sup35p and mouse PrP prion proteins was performed in neuroblastoma cells. The cytosolic expression of the Sup35p domains NM, PrP and fusion proteins thereof revealed that the carboxyterminal domain of PrP (PrP90-230) mediated aggregate formation, while Sup35p N and M domains modulated aggregate size and frequency when fused to the globular domain of PrP. Here we further present co-aggregation studies of chimeric proteins with cytosolic PrP or a huntingtin fragment with an extended polyglutamine tract. Our studies demonstrate that cross-seeding by heterologous proteins requires sequence similarity with the aggregated protein domain. Taken together, these results demonstrate that nucleation and seeding of prion protein aggregates is strongly influenced by dynamic interactions between the aggregate core forming domain and its flanking regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genomics of viruses and cellular life forms have greatly stimulated interest in the origins and evolution of viruses and, for the first time, offer an opportunity for a data-driven exploration of the deepest roots of viruses. Here we briefly review the current views of virus evolution and propose a new, coherent scenario that appears to be best compatible with comparative-genomic data and is naturally linked to models of cellular evolution that, from independent considerations, seem to be the most parsimonious among the existing ones.

RESULTS: Several genes coding for key proteins involved in viral replication and morphogenesis as well as the major capsid protein of icosahedral virions are shared by many groups of RNA and DNA viruses but are missing in cellular life forms. On the basis of this key observation and the data on extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses, we propose the concept of the ancient virus world. The virus world is construed as a distinct contingent of viral genes that continuously retained its identity throughout the entire history of life. Under this concept, the principal lineages of viruses and related selfish agents emerged from the primordial pool of primitive genetic elements, the ancestors of both cellular and viral genes. Thus, notwithstanding the numerous gene exchanges and acquisitions attributed to later stages of evolution, most, if not all, modern viruses and other selfish agents are inferred to descend from elements that belonged to the primordial genetic pool. In this pool, RNA viruses would evolve first, followed by retroid elements, and DNA viruses. The Virus World concept is predicated on a model of early evolution whereby emergence of substantial genetic diversity antedates the advent of full-fledged cells, allowing for extensive gene mixing at this early stage of evolution. We outline a scenario of the origin of the main classes of viruses in conjunction with a specific model of precellular evolution under which the primordial gene pool dwelled in a network of inorganic compartments. Somewhat paradoxically, under this scenario, we surmise that selfish genetic elements ancestral to viruses evolved prior to typical cells, to become intracellular parasites once bacteria and archaea arrived at the scene. Selection against excessively aggressive parasites that would kill off the host ensembles of genetic elements would lead to early evolution of temperate virus-like agents and primitive defense mechanisms, possibly, based on the RNA interference principle. The emergence of the eukaryotic cell is construed as the second melting pot of virus evolution from which the major groups of eukaryotic viruses originated as a result of extensive recombination of genes from various bacteriophages, archaeal viruses, plasmids, and the evolving eukaryotic genomes. Again, this vision is predicated on a specific model of the emergence of eukaryotic cell under which archaeo-bacterial symbiosis was the starting point of eukaryogenesis, a scenario that appears to be best compatible with the data.

CONCLUSION: The existence of several genes that are central to virus replication and structure, are shared by a broad variety of viruses but are missing from cellular genomes (virus hallmark genes) suggests the model of an ancient virus world, a flow of virus-specific genes that went uninterrupted from the precellular stage of life's evolution to this day. This concept is tightly linked to two key conjectures on evolution of cells: existence of a complex, precellular, compartmentalized but extensively mixing and recombining pool of genes, and origin of the eukaryotic cell by archaeo-bacterial fusion. The virus world concept and these models of major transitions in the evolution of cells provide complementary pieces of an emerging coherent picture of life's history.

abstract = {Protein synthesis requires a large commitment of cellular resources and is highly regulated. Previous studies have shown that a number of factors that mediate the initiation and elongation steps of translation are regulated by phosphorylation. In this report, we show that a factor involved in the termination step of protein synthesis is also subject to phosphorylation. Our results indicate that eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) is phosphorylated in vivo at serine 421 and serine 432 by the CK2 protein kinase (previously casein kinase II) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phosphorylation of eRF1 has little effect on the efficiency of stop codon recognition or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Also, phosphorylation is not required for eRF1 binding to the other translation termination factor, eRF3. In addition, we provide evidence that the putative phosphatase Sal6p does not dephosphorylate eRF1 and that the state of eRF1 phosphorylation does not influence the allosuppressor phenotype associated with a sal6Delta mutation. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of eRF1 is a dynamic process that is dependent upon carbon source availability. Since many other proteins involved in protein synthesis have a CK2 protein kinase motif near their extreme C termini, we propose that this represents a common regulatory mechanism that is shared by factors involved in all three stages of protein synthesis.},

Recently, over a dozen yeast genomes have been sequenced, providing the basis to resolve several complex biological questions. Analysis of the novel sequence data has shown that the minimum number of genes from each species that need to be compared to produce a reliable phylogeny is about 20. Yeast has also become an attractive model to study speciation in eukaryotes, especially to understand molecular mechanisms behind the establishment of reproductive isolation. Comparison of closely related species helps in gene annotation and to answer how many genes there really are within the genomes. Analysis of non-coding regions among closely related species has provided an example of how to determine novel gene regulatory sequences, which were previously difficult to analyse because they are short and degenerate and occupy different positions. Comparative genomics helps to understand the origin of yeasts and points out crucial molecular events in yeast evolutionary history, such as whole-genome duplication and horizontal gene transfer(s). In addition, the accumulating sequence data provide the background to use more yeast species in model studies, to combat pathogens and for efficient manipulation of industrial strains.},

@article{Cavalier-Smith2002,
abstract = {Eukaryotes and archaebacteria form the clade neomura and are sisters, as shown decisively by genes fragmented only in archaebacteria and by many sequence trees. This sisterhood refutes all theories that eukaryotes originated by merging an archaebacterium and an alpha-proteobacterium, which also fail to account for numerous features shared specifically by eukaryotes and actinobacteria. I revise the phagotrophy theory of eukaryote origins by arguing that the essentially autogenous origins of most eukaryotic cell properties (phagotrophy, endomembrane system including peroxisomes, cytoskeleton, nucleus, mitosis and sex) partially overlapped and were synergistic with the symbiogenetic origin of mitochondria from an alpha-proteobacterium. These radical innovations occurred in a derivative of the neomuran common ancestor, which itself had evolved immediately prior to the divergence of eukaryotes and archaebacteria by drastic alterations to its eubacterial ancestor, an actinobacterial posibacterium able to make sterols, by replacing murein peptidoglycan by N-linked glycoproteins and a multitude of other shared neomuran novelties. The conversion of the rigid neomuran wall into a flexible surface coat and the associated origin of phagotrophy were instrumental in the evolution of the endomembrane system, cytoskeleton, nuclear organization and division and sexual life-cycles. Cilia evolved not by symbiogenesis but by autogenous specialization of the cytoskeleton. I argue that the ancestral eukaryote was uniciliate with a single centriole (unikont) and a simple centrosomal cone of microtubules, as in the aerobic amoebozoan zooflagellate Phalansterium. I infer the root of the eukaryote tree at the divergence between opisthokonts (animals, Choanozoa, fungi) with a single posterior cilium and all other eukaryotes, designated 'anterokonts' because of the ancestral presence of an anterior cilium. Anterokonts comprise the Amoebozoa, which may be ancestrally unikont, and a vast ancestrally biciliate clade, named 'bikonts'. The apparently conflicting rRNA and protein trees can be reconciled with each other and this ultrastructural interpretation if long-branch distortions, some mechanistically explicable, are allowed for. Bikonts comprise two groups: corticoflagellates, with a younger anterior cilium, no centrosomal cone and ancestrally a semi-rigid cell cortex with a microtubular band on either side of the posterior mature centriole; and Rhizaria [a new infrakingdom comprising Cercozoa (now including Ascetosporea classis nov.), Retaria phylum nov., Heliozoa and Apusozoa phylum nov.], having a centrosomal cone or radiating microtubules and two microtubular roots and a soft surface, frequently with reticulopodia. Corticoflagellates comprise photokaryotes (Plantae and chromalveolates, both ancestrally with cortical alveoli) and Excavata (a new protozoan infrakingdom comprising Loukozoa, Discicristata and Archezoa, ancestrally with three microtubular roots). All basal eukaryotic radiations were of mitochondrial aerobes; hydrogenosomes evolved polyphyletically from mitochondria long afterwards, the persistence of their double envelope long after their genomes disappeared being a striking instance of membrane heredity. I discuss the relationship between the 13 protozoan phyla recognized here and revise higher protozoan classification by updating as subkingdoms Lankester's 1878 division of Protozoa into Corticata (Excavata, Alveolata; with prominent cortical microtubules and ancestrally localized cytostome--the Parabasalia probably secondarily internalized the cytoskeleton) and Gymnomyxa [infrakingdoms Sarcomastigota (Choanozoa, Amoebozoa) and Rhizaria; both ancestrally with a non-cortical cytoskeleton of radiating singlet microtubules and a relatively soft cell surface with diffused feeding]. As the eukaryote root almost certainly lies within Gymnomyxa, probably among the Sarcomastigota, Corticata are derived. Following the single symbiogenetic origin of chloroplasts in a corticoflagellate host with cortical alveoli, this ancestral plant radiated rapidly into glaucophytes, green plants and red algae. Secondary symbiogeneses subsequently transferred plastids laterally into different hosts, making yet more complex cell chimaeras--probably only thrice: from a red alga to the corticoflagellate ancestor of chromalveolates (Chromista plus Alveolata), from green algae to a secondarily uniciliate cercozoan to form chlorarachneans and independently to a biciliate excavate to yield photosynthetic euglenoids. Tertiary symbiogenesis involving eukaryotic algal symbionts replaced peridinin-containing plastids in two or three dinoflagellate lineages, but yielded no major novel groups. The origin and well-resolved primary bifurcation of eukaryotes probably occurred in the Cryogenian Period, about 850 million years ago, much more recently than suggested by unwarranted backward extrapolations of molecular 'clocks' or dubious interpretations as 'eukaryotic' of earlier large microbial fossils or still more ancient steranes. The origin of chloroplasts and the symbiogenetic incorporation of a red alga into a corticoflagellate to create chromalveolates may both have occurred in a big bang after the Varangerian snowball Earth melted about 580 million years ago, thereby stimulating the ensuing Cambrian explosion of animals and protists in the form of simultaneous, poorly resolved opisthokont and anterokont radiations.},

abstract = {Inactivation of HAL3 in the absence of SIT4 function leads to cell cycle arrest at the G(1)-S transition. To identify genes potentially involved in the control of this phase of the cell cycle, a screening for multicopy suppressors of a conditional sit4 hal3 mutant (strain JC002) has been developed. The screening yielded several genes known to perform key roles in cell cycle events, such as CLN3, BCK2 or SWI4, thus proving its usefulness as a tool for this type of studies. In addition, this approach allowed the identification of additional genes, most of them not previously related to the regulation of G(1)-S transition or even without known function (named here as VHS1-3, for viable in a hal3 sit4 background). Several of these gene products are involved in phospho-dephosphorylation processes, including members of the protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatases 2C families, as well as components of the Hal5 protein kinase family. The ability of different genes to suppress sit4 phenotypes (such as temperature sensitivity and growth on non-fermentable carbon sources) or to mimic the functions of Hal3 was evaluated. The possible relationship between the known functions of these suppressor genes and the progress through the G(1)-S transition is discussed.},

abstract = {A study of papers on amyloid fibers suggested to us that cylindrical beta-sheets are the only structures consistent with some of the x-ray and electron microscope data. We then found that our own 7-year-old and hitherto enigmatic x-ray diagram of poly-L-glutamine fits a cylindrical sheet of 31 A diameter made of beta-strands with 20 residues per helical turn. Successive turns are linked by hydrogen bonds between both the main chain and side chain amides, and side chains point alternately into and out of the cylinder. Fibers of the exon-1 peptide of huntingtin and of the glutamine- and asparagine-rich region of the yeast prion Sup35 give the same underlying x-ray diagrams, which show that they have the same structure. Electron micrographs show that the 100-A-thick fibers of the Sup35 peptide are ropes made of three protofibrils a little over 30 A thick. They have a measured mass of 1,450 Da/A, compared with 1,426 Da/A for a calculated mass of three protofibrils each with 20 residues per helical turn wound around each other with a helical pitch of 510 A. Published x-ray diagrams and electron micrographs show that fibers of synuclein, the protein that forms the aggregates of Parkinson disease, consist of single cylindrical beta-sheets. Fibers of Alzheimer A beta fragments and variants are probably made of either two or three concentric cylindrical beta-sheets. Our structure of poly-L-glutamine fibers may explain why, in all but one of the neurodegenerative diseases resulting from extension of glutamine repeats, disease occurs when the number of repeats exceeds 37-40. A single helical turn with 20 residues would be unstable, because there is nothing to hold it in place, but two turns with 40 residues are stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between their amides and can act as nuclei for further helical growth. The A beta peptide of Alzheimer's disease contains 42 residues, the best number for nucleating further growth. All these structures are very stable; the best hope for therapies lies in preventing their growth.},

abstract = {We performed genome-wide expression analysis to determine genetic responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a low temperature environment using a cDNA microarray. Approximately 25{\%} of the genes in the yeast genome were found to be involved in the response of yeast to low temperature. This finding of a large number of genes being involved in the response to low temperature enabled us to give a functional interpretation to the genetic responses to the stimulus. Functional and clustering analyses of temporal changes in gene expression revealed that global states of the expressions of up-regulated genes could be characterized as having three phases (the early, middle, and late phases). In each phase, genes related to rRNA synthesis, ribosomal proteins, or several stress responses are time-dependently up-regulated, respectively. Through these phases, yeast cells may improve reduced efficiency of translation and enhance cell protection mechanisms to survive under a low temperature condition. Furthermore, these time-dependent regulations of these genes would be controlled by the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. The results of our study provide a global description of transcriptional response for adaptation to low temperature in yeast cells.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to altered oxygen availability by differentially expressing a number of genes. Under aerobic conditions oxygen control of gene expression is exerted through the activator Hap1 and the repressor Rox1. The Hap1 transcription factor senses cellular heme status and increases expression of aerobic genes in response to oxygen. The repression of hypoxic genes under normoxic conditions results from Hap1-mediated activation of ROX1 transcription. To allow the identification of additional Hap1 and Rox1 target genes, genome-wide expression was analysed in aerobically, chemostat-cultivated hap1 and rox1 null mutants. The microarray results show that deletion of HAP1 causes a lower transcript level of 51 genes. Transcription of 40 genes was increased in rox1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. Combining these results with our previously described transcriptome data of aerobically and anaerobically grown cells and with computational analysis of the promoters identified 24 genes that are potentially regulated by Hap1, and 38 genes satisfied the criteria of being direct targets of Rox1. In addition, this work provides further evidence that Rox1 controls transcription of anaerobic genes through repression under normoxic conditions.},

abstract = {The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains numerous unstable microsatellite sequences. Mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats are rarely found in ORFs, and when present in an ORF are frequently located in an intron or at the C terminus of the protein, suggesting that their instability is deleterious to gene function. DNA trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are found at a higher-than-expected frequency within ORFs, and the amino acids encoded by the TNRs represent a biased set. TNRs are rarely conserved between genes with related sequences, suggesting high instability or a recent origin. The genes in which TNRs are most frequently found are related to cellular regulation. The protein structural database is notably lacking in proteins containing amino acid tracts, suggesting that they are not located in structured regions of a protein but are rather located between domains. This conclusion is consistent with the location of amino acid tracts in two protein families. The preferred location of TNRs within the ORFs of genes related to cellular regulation together with their instability suggest that TNRs could have an important role in speciation. Specifically, TNRs could serve as hot spots for recombination leading to domain swapping, or mutation of TNRs could allow rapid evolution of new domains of protein structure.},

We characterized phenotypes of mutations using codon-specific nonsense suppressors and the test employing inactivation of the release factor Sup35 due to overexpression and formation of prion-like derivative [PSI]. We have shown that HAP induces predominantly nonsense mutations. While the tests using codon-specific nonsense-suppressors allowed to identify only about 50{\%} of nonsense-mutations, all the nonsense-mutations were identified in the test with defective Sup35. We determined and analyzed the spectrum of HAP-induced nucleotide changes in two regions of the gene. HAP induces predominantly GC-->AT transitions in a hotspots of a central position of trinucleotide GGA or AGG. Directionality of these transitions is consistent with the idea that initial dHAPMP incorporation in the leading strand is more genetically dangerous than in lagging DNA strand. We revealed a specific context inhibitory for HAP mutagenesis, a "T" in -1 position to mutation site.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the SCR1 gene from Schwanniomyces occidentalis is known to induce ribosomal resistance to cycloheximide (cyh). A 2.8 kb DNA fragment encoding this gene was sequenced. Its EMBL Accession No. is AJ419770. It disclosed a putative tRNA(Asn) (GUU) sequence located downstream of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1641 nucleotides. This ORF was shown to correspond to SCR1. It would encode a highly hydrophobic polypeptide (SCR1) with 12 transmembrane domains. SCR1 is highly similar to a variety of yeast proteins of the multidrug-resistance (MDR) family. However, SCR1 only conferred resistance to cyh but not to benomyl or methotrexate. The cyh-resistance phenotype induced by SCR1 was confirmed in several S. cerevisiae strains that expressed this gene to reside at the ribosomal level. In contrast, a beta-galacosidase-tagged SCR1 was found to be integrated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is proposed that the ribosomes of yeast cells expressing SCR1 undergo a conformational change during their interaction with the ER, which lowers their affinity for cyh-binding. If so, these findings would disclose a novel ribosomal resistance mechanism.},

@article{Contamine2000,
abstract = {Instability of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is a general problem from yeasts to humans. However, its genetic control is not well documented except in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From the discovery, 50 years ago, of the petite mutants by Ephrussi and his coworkers, it has been shown that more than 100 nuclear genes directly or indirectly influence the fate of the rho(+) mtDNA. It is not surprising that mutations in genes involved in mtDNA metabolism (replication, repair, and recombination) can cause a complete loss of mtDNA (rho(0) petites) and/or lead to truncated forms (rho(-)) of this genome. However, most loss-of-function mutations which increase yeast mtDNA instability act indirectly: they lie in genes controlling functions as diverse as mitochondrial translation, ATP synthase, iron homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial morphology, and so on. In a few cases it has been shown that gene overexpression increases the levels of petite mutants. Mutations in other genes are lethal in the absence of a functional mtDNA and thus convert this petite-positive yeast into a petite-negative form: petite cells cannot be recovered in these genetic contexts. Most of the data are explained if one assumes that the maintenance of the rho(+) genome depends on a centromere-like structure dispensable for the maintenance of rho(-) mtDNA and/or the function of mitochondrially encoded ATP synthase subunits, especially ATP6. In fact, the real challenge for the next 50 years will be to assemble the pieces of this puzzle by using yeast and to use complementary models, especially in strict aerobes.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying los1-1 mutations are defective in tRNA processing; at 37 degrees C, such strains accumulate tRNA precursors which have mature 5' and 3' ends but contain intervening sequences. Strains bearing los1-1 and an intron-containing ochre-suppressing tRNA gene, SUP4(0), also fail to suppress the ochre mutations ade2-1(0) and can1-100(0) at 34 degrees C. To understand the role of the LOS1 product in tRNA splicing, we initiated a molecular study of the LOS1 gene. Two plasmids, YEpLOS1 and YCpLOS1, that complement the los1-1 phenotype were isolated from the YEp24 and YCp50 libraries, respectively. YEpLOS1 and YCpLOS1 had overlapping restriction maps, indicating that the DNA in the overlapping segment could complement los1-1 when present in multiple or single copy. Integration of plasmid DNA at the LOS1 locus confirmed that these clones contained authentic LOS1 sequences. Southern analyses showed that LOS1 is a single copy gene. The locations of the LOS1 gene within YEpLOS1 and YCpLOS1 were determined by deletion and gamma-delta mapping. Two genomic disruptions of the LOS1 gene were constructed, i.e., an insertion of a 1.2-kilobase fragment carrying the yeast URA3 gene, los1::URA3, and a 2.4-kilobase deletion from the LOS1 gene, los1-delta V. Disruption or deletion of most of the LOS1 gene was not lethal; cells carrying the disrupted los1 alleles were viable and had phenotypes similar to those of cells carrying the los1-1 allele. Thus, it appears that the los1 gene product expedites tRNA splicing at elevated temperatures but is not essential for this process.},

abstract = {Self-perpetuating protein aggregates transmit prion diseases in mammals and heritable traits in yeast. De novo prion formation can be induced by transient overproduction of the corresponding prion-forming protein or its prion domain. Here, we demonstrate that the yeast prion protein Sup35 interacts with various proteins of the actin cortical cytoskeleton that are involved in endocytosis. Sup35-derived aggregates, generated in the process of prion induction, are associated with the components of the endocytic/vacuolar pathway. Mutational alterations of the cortical actin cytoskeleton decrease aggregation of overproduced Sup35 and de novo prion induction and increase prion-related toxicity in yeast. Deletion of the gene coding for the actin assembly protein Sla2 is lethal in cells containing the prion isoforms of both Sup35 and Rnq1 proteins simultaneously. Our data are consistent with a model in which cytoskeletal structures provide a scaffold for generation of large aggregates, resembling mammalian aggresomes. These aggregates promote prion formation. Moreover, it appears that the actin cytoskeleton also plays a certain role in counteracting the toxicity of the overproduced potentially aggregating proteins.},

abstract = {We have developed a rapid, yeast-based, two-step assay to screen for antiprion drugs. The method allowed us to identify several compounds effective against budding yeast prions responsible for the [PSI+] and [URE3] phenotypes. These inhibitors include the kastellpaolitines, a new class of compounds, and two previously known molecules, phenanthridine and 6-aminophenanthridine. Two potent promoters of mammalian prion clearance in vitro, quinacrine and chlorpromazine, which share structural similarities with the kastellpaolitines, were also active in the assay. The compounds isolated here were also active in promoting mammalian prion clearance. These results validate the present method as an efficient high-throughput screening approach to identify new prion inhibitors and furthermore suggest that biochemical pathways controlling prion formation and/or maintenance are conserved from yeast to humans.},

abstract = {Prion proteins can adopt multiple infectious strain conformations. Here we investigate how the sequence of a prion protein affects its capacity to propagate specific conformations by exploiting our ability to create two distinct infectious conformations of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion protein Sup35, termed Sc4 and Sc37. PNM2, a G58D point mutant of Sup35 that was originally identified for its dominant interference with prion propagation, leads to rapid, recessive loss of Sc4 but does not interfere with propagation of Sc37. PNM2 destabilizes the amyloid core of Sc37 and causes compensatory effects that slow prion growth but aid prion division and result in robust propagation of Sc37. By contrast, PNM2 does not affect the structure or chaperone-mediated division of Sc4 but interferes with its delivery to daughter cells. Thus, effective delivery of infectious particles during cell division is a crucial and conformation-dependent step in prion inheritance.},

@article{Toombs2011,
abstract = {[PSI(+)], the prion form of the yeast Sup35 protein, results from the structural conversion of Sup35 from a soluble form into an infectious amyloid form. The infectivity of prions is thought to result from chaperone-dependent fiber cleavage that breaks large prion fibers into smaller, inheritable propagons. Like the mammalian prion protein PrP, Sup35 contains an oligopeptide repeat domain. Deletion analysis indicates that the oligopeptide repeat domain is critical for [PSI(+)] propagation, while a distinct region of the prion domain is responsible for prion nucleation. The PrP oligopeptide repeat domain can substitute for the Sup35 oligopeptide repeat domain in supporting [PSI(+)] propagation, suggesting a common role for repeats in supporting prion maintenance. However, randomizing the order of the amino acids in the Sup35 prion domain does not block prion formation or propagation, suggesting that amino acid composition is the primary determinant of Sup35's prion propensity. Thus, it is unclear what role the oligopeptide repeats play in [PSI(+)] propagation: the repeats could simply act as a non-specific spacer separating the prion nucleation domain from the rest of the protein; the repeats could contain specific compositional elements that promote prion propagation; or the repeats, while not essential for prion propagation, might explain some unique features of [PSI(+)]. Here, we test these three hypotheses and show that the ability of the Sup35 and PrP repeats to support [PSI(+)] propagation stems from their amino acid composition, not their primary sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compositional requirements for the repeat domain are distinct from those of the nucleation domain, indicating that prion nucleation and propagation are driven by distinct compositional features.},

abstract = {Yeast prion [PSI(+)] is a self-perpetuating amyloid of the translational termination factor Sup35. Although [PSI(+)] propagation is modulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps), high temperature was previously reported to have little or no effect on [PSI(+)]. Our results show that short-term exposure of exponentially growing yeast culture to mild heat shock, followed by immediate resumption of growth, leads to [PSI(+)] destabilization, sometimes persisting for several cell divisions after heat shock. Prion loss occurring in the first division after heat shock is preferentially detected in a daughter cell, indicating the impairment of prion segregation that results in asymmetric prion distribution between a mother cell and a bud. Longer heat shock or prolonged incubation in the absence of nutrients after heat shock led to [PSI(+)] recovery. Both prion destabilization and recovery during heat shock depend on protein synthesis. Maximal prion destabilization coincides with maximal imbalance between Hsp104 and other Hsps such as Hsp70-Ssa. Deletions of individual SSA genes increase prion destabilization and/or counteract recovery. The dynamics of prion aggregation during destabilization and recovery are consistent with the notion that efficient prion fragmentation and segregation require a proper balance between Hsp104 and other (e.g., Hsp70-Ssa) chaperones. In contrast to heat shock, [PSI(+)] destabilization by osmotic stressors does not always depend on cell proliferation and/or protein synthesis, indicating that different stresses may impact the prion via different mechanisms. Our data demonstrate that heat stress causes asymmetric prion distribution in a cell division and confirm that the effects of Hsps on prions are physiologically relevant.},

Atomic-resolution characterization of the mechanisms responsible for the aggregation process and the resulting structures is thus a necessary step to improve our understanding of the determinants of these pathologies. To address this issue, we combine the accelerated sampling properties of replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations based on the OPEP coarse-grained potential with the atomic resolution description of interactions provided by all-atom MD simulations, and investigate the oligomerization process of the GNNQQNY for three system sizes: 3-mers, 12-mers and 20-mers. Results for our integrated simulations show a rich variety of structural arrangements for aggregates of all sizes. Elongated fibril-like structures can form transiently in the 20-mer case, but they are not stable and easily interconvert in more globular and disordered forms. Our extensive characterization of the intermediate structures and their physico-chemical determinants points to a high degree of polymorphism for the GNNQQNY sequence that can be reflected at the macroscopic scale. Detailed mechanisms and structures that underlie amyloid aggregation are also provided.},

abstract = {A remarkable feature of prion biology is that the same prion protein can misfold into more than one infectious conformation, and these conformations in turn lead to distinct heritable prion strains with different phenotypes. The yeast prion [PSI(+)] is a powerful system for studying how changes in strain conformation affect cross-species transmission. We have previously established that a chimera of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Candida albicans (CA) Sup35 prion domains can cross the SC/CA species barrier in a strain-dependent manner. In vitro, the conversion of the monomeric chimera into the prion (amyloid) form can be seeded by either SC or CA Sup35 amyloid fibers, resulting in two strains: Chim[SC] and Chim[CA]. These strains have a "molecular memory" of their originating species in that Chim[SC] preferentially seeds the conversion of SC Sup35, and vice versa. To investigate how this species specificity is conformationally encoded, we used amide exchange and limited proteolysis to probe the structures of these two strains. We found that the amyloid cores of Chim[SC] and Chim[CA] are predominantly confined to the SC-derived and CA-derived residues, respectively. In addition, the chimera is able to propagate the Chim[CA] conformation even when the SC residues comprising the Chim[SC] core were deleted. Thus, the two strains have non-overlapping and modular amyloid cores that determine whether SC or CA residues are presented on the growing face of the prion seed. These observations establish how conformations determine the specificity of prion transmission and demonstrate a remarkable plasticity to amyloid misfolding.},

abstract = {Sequences rich in glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) residues often fail to fold at the monomer level. This, coupled to their unusual hydrogen-bonding abilities, provides the driving force to switch between disordered monomers and amyloids. Such transitions govern processes as diverse as human protein-folding diseases, bacterial biofilm assembly, and the inheritance of yeast prions (protein-based genetic elements). A systematic survey of prion-forming domains suggested that Q and N residues have distinct effects on amyloid formation. Here, we use cell biological, biochemical, and computational techniques to compare Q/N-rich protein variants, replacing Ns with Qs and Qs with Ns. We find that the two residues have strong and opposing effects: N richness promotes assembly of benign self-templating amyloids; Q richness promotes formation of toxic nonamyloid conformers. Molecular simulations focusing on intrinsic folding differences between Qs and Ns suggest that their different behaviors are due to the enhanced turn-forming propensity of Ns over Qs.},

Although cells typically recognize and process misfolded proteins, prion proteins evade protective measures by forming stable, self-replicating aggregates. However, coexpression of dominant-negative prion mutants can overcome aggregate accumulation and disease progression through currently unknown pathways. Here we determine the mechanisms by which two mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35 protein cure the [PSI(+)] prion. We show that both mutants incorporate into wild-type aggregates and alter their physical properties in different ways, diminishing either their assembly rate or their thermodynamic stability. Whereas wild-type aggregates are recalcitrant to cellular intervention, mixed aggregates are disassembled by the molecular chaperone Hsp104. Thus, rather than simply blocking misfolding, dominant-negative prion mutants target multiple events in aggregate biogenesis to enhance their susceptibility to endogenous quality-control pathways.},

De novo prion formation by overproduced prion protein is facilitated by other aggregated QN-rich protein(s) and is influenced by alterations of protein homeostasis. Here we explore the mechanism by which the Las17-binding protein Lsb2 (Pin3) promotes conversion of the translation termination factor Sup35 into its prion form, [PSI(+)]. We show that Lsb2 localizes with some Sup35 aggregates and that Lsb2 is a short-lived protein whose levels are controlled via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and are dramatically increased by stress. Loss of Lsb2 decreases stability of [PSI(+)] after brief heat shock. Mutations interfering with Lsb2 ubiquitination increase prion induction, while a mutation eliminating association of Lsb2 with the actin cytoskeleton blocks its aggregation and prion-inducing ability. These findings directly implicate the UPS and actin cytoskeleton in regulating prions via a stress-inducible QN-rich protein.},

Transfection experiments have shown that Sup35p filaments assembled in vitro are infectious, suggesting that they reproduce or closely resemble the prion. We have used several EM techniques to study the molecular architecture of filaments, seeking clues as to the mechanism of downregulation. Sup35p has an N-terminal 'prion' domain; a highly charged middle (M-)domain; and a C-terminal domain with the translation termination activity. By negative staining, cryo-EM and scanning transmission EM (STEM), filaments of full-length Sup35p show a thin backbone fibril surrounded by a diffuse 65-nm-wide cloud of globular C-domains. In diameter (∼8 nm) and appearance, the backbones resemble amyloid fibrils of N-domains alone. STEM mass-per-unit-length data yield ∼1 subunit per 0.47 nm for N-fibrils, NM-filaments and Sup35p filaments, further supporting the fibril backbone model. The 30 nm radial span of decorating C-domains indicates that the M-domains assume highly extended conformations, offering an explanation for the residual Sup35p activity in infected cells, whereby the C-domains remain free enough to interact with ribosomes.},

abstract = {Replication of amyloid-based yeast prions [PSI(+)], [URE3], and [PIN(+)] depends on the protein disaggregation machinery that includes Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40 molecular chaperones. Yet, overexpressing Hsp104 cures cells of [PSI(+)] prions. An Hsp70 mutant (Ssa1-21p) antagonizes propagation of [PSI(+)] in a manner resembling elevated Hsp104. The major cytosolic Hsp40 Sis1p is the only Hsp40 required for replication of these prions, but its role in [PSI(+)] curing is unknown. Here we find that all nonessential functional regions of Sis1p are dispensable for [PSI(+)] propagation, suggesting that other Hsp40's might provide Hsp40 functions required for [PSI(+)] replication. Conversely, several Sis1p functions were important for promoting antiprion effects of both Ssa1-21p and Hsp104, which implies a link between the antiprion effects of these chaperones and suggests that Sis1p is a specific Hsp40 important for [PSI(+)] curing. These contrasting findings suggest that the functions of Hsp104 that are important for propagation and elimination of [PSI(+)] are either distinct or specified by different Hsp40's. This work also uncovered a growth inhibition caused by [PSI(+)] when certain functions of Sis1p were absent, suggesting that Sis1p protects cells from cytotoxicity caused by [PSI(+)] prions.},

abstract = {A variety of proteins are capable of converting from their soluble forms into highly ordered fibrous cross-beta aggregates (amyloids). This conversion is associated with certain pathological conditions in mammals, such as Alzheimer disease, and provides a basis for the infectious or hereditary protein isoforms (prions), causing neurodegenerative disorders in mammals and controlling heritable phenotypes in yeast. The N-proximal region of the yeast prion protein Sup35 (Sup35NM) is frequently used as a model system for amyloid conversion studies in vitro. Traditionally, amyloids are recognized by their ability to bind Congo Red dye specific to beta-sheet rich structures. However, methods for quantifying amyloid fibril formation thus far were based on measurements linking Congo Red absorbance to concentration of insulin fibrils and may not be directly applicable to other amyloid-forming proteins. Here, we present a corrected formula for measuring amyloid formation of Sup35NM by Congo Red assay. By utilizing this corrected procedure, we explore the effect of different sodium salts on the lag time and maximum rate of amyloid formation by Sup35NM. We find that increased kosmotropicity promotes amyloid polymerization in accordance with the Hofmeister series. In contrast, chaotropes inhibit polymerization, with the strength of inhibition correlating with the B-viscosity coefficient of the Jones-Dole equation, an increasingly accepted measure for the quantification of the Hofmeister series.},

abstract = {Although propagation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae prions requires Hsp104 protein disaggregating activity, overproducing Hsp104 "cures" cells of [PSI(+)] prions. Earlier evidence suggests that the Hsp70 mutant Ssa1-21 impairs [PSI(+)] by a related mechanism. Here, we confirm this link by finding that deletion of STI1 both suppresses Ssa1-21 impairment of [PSI(+)] and blocks Hsp104 curing of [PSI(+)]. Hsp104's tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) interaction motif was dispensable for curing; however, cells expressing Sti1 defective in Hsp70 or Hsp90 interaction cured less efficiently, and the Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol abolished curing, implying that Sti1 acts in curing through Hsp70 and Hsp90 interactions. Accordingly, strains lacking constitutive or inducible Hsp90 isoforms cured at reduced rates. We confirm an earlier finding that elevating free ubiquitin levels enhances curing, but it did not overcome inhibition of curing caused by Hsp90 defects, suggesting that Hsp90 machinery is important for the contribution of ubiquitin to curing. We also find curing associated with cell division. Our findings point to crucial roles of Hsp70, Sti1, and Hsp90 for efficient curing by overexpressed Hsp104 and provide evidence supporting the earlier suggestion that destruction of prions by protein disaggregation does not adequately explain the curing.},

abstract = {Aggregation-prone proteins often misfold into multiple distinct amyloid conformations that dictate different physiological impacts. Although amyloid formation is triggered by a transient nucleus, the mechanism by which an initial nucleus is formed and allows the protein to form a specific amyloid conformation has been unclear. Here we show that, before fiber formation, the prion domain (Sup35NM, consisting of residues 1-254) of yeast prion Sup35, the [PSI(+)] protein determinant, forms oligomers in a temperature-dependent, reversible manner. Mutational and biophysical analyses revealed that 'non-native' aromatic interactions outside the amyloid core drive oligomer formation by bringing together different Sup35NM monomers, which specifically leads to the formation of highly infectious strain conformations with more limited amyloid cores. Thus, transient non-native interactions in the initial nucleus are pivotal in determining the diversity of amyloid conformations and resulting prion strain phenotypes.},

abstract = {Amyloid-like fibrils can be formed by many different proteins and peptides. The structural characteristics of these fibers are very similar to those of amyloid fibrils that are deposited in a number of protein misfolding diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The elucidation of two crystal structures from an amyloid-like fibril-forming fragment of the yeast prion, Sup35, with sequence GNNQQNY, has contributed to knowledge regarding side-chain packing of amyloid-forming peptides. Both structures share a cross-beta steric zipper arrangement but vary in the packing of the peptide, particularly in terms of the tyrosine residue. We investigated the fibrillar and crystalline structure and assembly of the GNNQQNY peptide using x-ray fiber diffraction, electron microscopy, intrinsic and quenched tyrosine fluorescence, and linear dichroism. Electron micrographs reveal that at concentrations between 0.5 and 10 mg/mL, fibers form initially, followed by crystals. Fluorescence studies suggest that the environment of the tyrosine residue changes as crystals form. This is corroborated by linear dichroism experiments that indicate a change in the orientation of the tyrosine residue over time, which suggests that a structural rearrangement occurs as the crystals form. Experimental x-ray diffraction patterns from fibers and crystals also suggest that these species are structurally distinct. A comparison of experimental and calculated diffraction patterns contributes to an understanding of the different arrangements accessed by the peptide.},

We analyzed [PSI(+)] cells in which Sup35 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) formed aggregates visible by fluorescence microscopy using thin-section electron microscopy (EM). Rapid-freeze EM combined with an immunogold-labeling technique as well as correlative light EM, which allows high-resolution imaging by EM of the same structure observed by light (fluorescence) microscopy, shows that the aggregates contain bundled fibrillar structures of Sup35-GFP. Additional biochemical and fluorescent correlation spectroscopy results suggest that the Sup35 oligomers diffused in the [PSI(+)] lysates adopt fibril-like shapes. Our findings demonstrate that [PSI(+)] cells contain Sup35 fibrillar structures closely related to those formed in vitro and provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which Sup35 aggregates are assembled and remodeled in [PSI(+)] cells.},

abstract = {The glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich yeast prion protein Sup35 has a low intrinsic propensity to spontaneously self-assemble into ordered, beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils. In yeast cells, de novo formation of Sup35 aggregates is greatly facilitated by high protein concentrations and the presence of preformed Q/N-rich protein aggregates that template Sup35 polymerization. Here, we have investigated whether aggregation-promoting polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts can stimulate the de novo formation of ordered Sup35 protein aggregates in the absence of Q/N-rich yeast prions. Fusion proteins with polyQ tracts of different lengths were produced and their ability to spontaneously self-assemble into amlyloid structures was analyzed using in vitro and in vivo model systems. We found that Sup35 fusions with pathogenic (>or=54 glutamines), as opposed to non-pathogenic (19 glutamines) polyQ tracts efficiently form seeding-competent protein aggregates. Strikingly, polyQ-mediated de novo assembly of Sup35 protein aggregates in yeast cells was independent of pre-existing Q/N-rich protein aggregates. This indicates that increasing the content of aggregation-promoting sequences enhances the tendency of Sup35 to spontaneously self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates. A similar result was obtained when pathogenic polyQ tracts were linked to the yeast prion protein Rnq1, demonstrating that polyQ sequences are generic inducers of amyloidogenesis. In conclusion, long polyQ sequences are powerful molecular tools that allow the efficient production of seeding-competent amyloid structures.},

@article{Vishveshwara2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prions are self-perpetuating, infectious, aggregated proteins that are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases in mammals and heritable traits in yeast. Sup35p, the protein determinant of the yeast prion [PSI+], has a conserved C terminal domain that performs the Sup35p function and a prion domain that is highly divergent. Prions formed by chimeras of the prion domain of various species fused to the C domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit a 'species barrier', a phenomenon first observed in mammals, and often fail to transmit the prion state to chimeras with prion domains of other species.

RESULTS: We focus on the chimera containing the prion domain of Pichia methanolica and examine how tight the 'species barrier' is between the chimera and S. cerevisiae. Although either of two Q/N-rich prions, [PSI+] or [PIN+], enhances the formation of the chimeric prion, [CHI+PM], neither a non-Q/N-rich prion nor a non-prion Q-rich aggregate promotes the formation of [CHI+PM]. [CHI+PM] has many features characteristic of yeast prions: aggregation, cytoplasmic transmission and a two-level protein structure. [CHI+PM] formed in the presence of [PSI+] can propagate independently of [PSI+] and forms at least two different variants of the prion, suggesting the generation and not transmission of new prion seeds.

CONCLUSION: Although the sequence similarity between the S. cerevisiae Q/N-rich prion determinants and the P. methanolica prion domain is low, we find that the chimera containing the prion domain of P. methanolica can occasionally be cross-seeded by [PSI+] to mimic crossing the species barrier, to form the [CHI+PM] prion. Our data suggests that crossing the barrier occurs by a de novo formation of the foreign chimeric prion. Thus, the species barrier appears to be crossed by a heterologous seeding mechanism, wherein the infected prion protein uses the pre-existing seed as an inefficient template.},

abstract = {The Sup35 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae forms a prion that generates the [PSI(+)] phenotype. Its NM region governs prion status, forming self-seeding amyloid fibers in vivo and in vitro. A tryptophan mutant of Sup35 (NM(F117W)) was used to probe its aggregation. Four indicators of aggregation, Trp 117 maximum emission, Trp polarization, thio-T binding, and light scattering increase, revealed faster aggregation at 4 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, and all indicators changed in a concerted fashion at the former temperature. Curiously, at 25 degrees C the changes were not synchronized; the first two indicators, which reflect nucleation, changed more quickly than the last two, which reflect fibril formation. These results suggest that nucleation is insensitive to temperature, whereas fibril extension is temperature dependent. As expected, aggregation is accelerated when a small fraction (5{\%}) of the nuclei produced at 4 or 25 degrees C are added to a suspension containing the soluble NM domain, although these nuclei do not seem to propagate any structural information to the growing fibrils. Fibrils grown at 4 degrees C were less stable in GdmCl than those grown at higher temperature. However, they were both resistant to high pressure; in fact, both sets of fibrils responded to high pressure by adopting an altered conformation with a higher capacity for thio-T binding. From these data, we calculated the change in volume and free energy associated with this conformational change. AFM revealed that the fibrils grown at 4 degrees C were statistically smaller than those grown at 25 degrees C. In conclusion, the introduction of Trp 117 allowed us to more carefully dissect the effects of temperature on the aggregation of the Sup35 NM domain.},

abstract = {Several cellular chaperones have been shown to affect the propagation of the yeast prions [PSI(+)], [PIN(+)] and [URE3]. Ssa1 and Ssa2 are Hsp70 family chaperones that generally cause pro-[PSI(+)] effects, since dominant-negative mutants of Ssa1 or Ssa2 cure [PSI(+)], and overexpression of Ssa1 enhances de novo [PSI(+)] appearance and prevents curing by excess Hsp104. In contrast, Ssa1 was shown to have anti-[URE3] effects, since overexpression of Ssa1 cures [URE3]. Here we show that excess Ssa1 or Ssa2 can also cure [PSI(+)]. This curing is enhanced in the presence of [PIN(+)]. During curing, Sup35-GFP fluorescent aggregates get bigger and fewer in number, which leads to their being diluted out during cell division, a phenotype that was also observed during the curing of [PSI(+)] by certain variants of [PIN(+)]. The sizes of the detergent-resistant [PSI(+)] prion oligomers increase during [PSI(+)] curing by excess Ssa1. Excess Ssa1 likewise leads to an increase in oligomer sizes of low, medium and very high [PIN(+)] variants. While these phenotypes are also caused by inhibition of Hsp104 or Sis1, the overexpression of Ssa1 did not cause any change in Hsp104 or Sis1 levels.},

abstract = {Propagation of yeast prions requires normal abundance and activity of many protein chaperones. Central among them is Hsp70, a ubiquitous and essential chaperone involved in many diverse cellular processes that helps promote proper protein folding and acts as a critical component of several chaperone machines. Hsp70 is regulated by a large cohort of co-chaperones, whose effects on prions are likely mediated through Hsp70. Hsp104 is another chaperone, absent from mammalian cells, that resolubilizes proteins from aggregates. This activity, which minimally requires Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40, is essential for yeast prion replication. Although much is known about how yeast prions can be affected by altering protein chaperones, mechanistic explanations for these effects are uncertain. We discuss the variety of effects Hsp70 and its regulators have on different prions and how the effects might be due to the many ways chaperones interact with each other and with amyloid.},

abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI(+)] is a protein-based heritable element, in which aggregates of Sup35 protein are transmitted to daughter cells in a non-Mendelian manner. To elucidate the mechanism of the transmission, we have developed methods to directly analyse the dynamics of Sup35 fused with GFP in single mother-daughter pairs. As it is known that the treatment of yeast cells with guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) cures [PSI(+)] by perturbing Hsp104, a prion-remodelling factor, we analysed the diffusion profiles of Sup35-GFP in GuHCl-treated [PSI(+)] cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS analyses revealed that Sup35-GFP diffusion in the daughter cells was faster; that is, the Sup35-GFP particle was smaller, than that in the mother [PSI(+)] cells, and it eventually reached the diffusion profiles in [psi(-)] cells. We then analysed the flux of Sup35-GFP oligomers from mother to daughter [PSI(+)] cells in the presence of GuHCl, using a modified fluorescent recovery after photobleaching technique, and found that the flux of the diffuse oligomers was completely inhibited. The noninvasive methods described here can be applied to other protein-based transmissible systems inside living cells.},

abstract = {The [PSI(+)] prion may enhance evolvability by revealing previously cryptic genetic variation, but it is unclear whether such evolvability properties could be favored by natural selection. Sex inhibits the evolution of other putative evolvability mechanisms, such as mutator alleles. This paper explores whether sex also prevents natural selection from favoring modifier alleles that facilitate [PSI(+)] formation. Sex may permit the spread of "cheater" alleles that acquire the benefits of [PSI(+)] through mating without incurring the cost of producing [PSI(+)] at times when it is not adaptive. Using recent quantitative estimates of the frequency of sex in Saccharomyces paradoxus, we calculate that natural selection for evolvability can drive the evolution of the [PSI(+)] system, so long as yeast populations occasionally require complex adaptations involving synergistic epistasis between two loci. If adaptations are always simple and require substitution at only a single locus, then the [PSI(+)] system is not favored by natural selection. Obligate sex might inhibit the evolution of [PSI(+)]-like systems in other species.},

abstract = {The Gpg1 protein is a Ggamma subunit mimic implicated in the G-protein glucose-signaling pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its function is largely unknown. Here we report that Gpg1 blocks the maintenance of [PSI(+)], an aggregated prion form of the translation termination factor Sup35. Although the GPG1 gene is normally not expressed, over-expression of GPG1 inhibits propagation of not only [PSI(+)] but also [PIN(+)], [URE3] prions, and the toxic polyglutamine aggregate in S. cerevisiae. Over-expression of Gpg1 does not affect expression and activity of Hsp104, a protein-remodeling factor required for prion propagation, showing that Gpg1 does not target Hsp104 directly. Nevertheless, prion elimination by Gpg1 is weakened by over-expression of Hsp104. Importantly, Gpg1 protein is prone to self-aggregate and transiently colocalized with Sup35NM-prion aggregates when expressed in [PSI(+)] cells. Genetic selection and characterization of loss-of-activity gpg1 mutations revealed that multiple mutations on the hydrophobic one-side surface of predicted alpha-helices of the Gpg1 protein hampered the activity. Prion elimination by Gpg1 is unaffected in the gpa2Delta and gpb1Delta strains lacking the supposed physiological G-protein partners of Gpg1. These findings suggest a general inhibitory interaction of the Gpg1 protein with other transmissible and nontransmissible amyloids, resulting in prion elimination. Assuming the ability of Gpg1 to form G-protein heterotrimeric complexes, Gpg1 is likely to play a versatile function of reversing the prion state and modulating the G-protein signaling pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) prions are efficiently propagated and the on-going generation and transmission of prion seeds (propagons) to daughter cells during cell division ensures a high degree of mitotic stability. The reversible inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp104p by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) results in cell division-dependent elimination of yeast prions due to a block in propagon generation and the subsequent dilution out of propagons by cell division.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysing the kinetics of the GdnHCl-induced elimination of the yeast [PSI+] prion has allowed us to develop novel statistical models that aid our understanding of prion propagation in yeast cells. Here we describe the application of a new stochastic model that allows us to estimate more accurately the mean number of propagons in a [PSI+] cell. To achieve this accuracy we also experimentally determine key cell reproduction parameters and show that the presence of the [PSI+] prion has no impact on these key processes. Additionally, we experimentally determine the proportion of propagons transmitted to a daughter cell and show this reflects the relative cell volume of mother and daughter cells at cell division.

CONCLUSIONS: While propagon generation is an ATP-driven process, the partition of propagons to daughter cells occurs by passive transfer via the distribution of cytoplasm. Furthermore, our new estimates of n(0), the number of propagons per cell (500-1000), are some five times higher than our previous estimates and this has important implications for our understanding of the inheritance of the [PSI+] and the spontaneous formation of prion-free cells.},

Yeast prion formation is driven primarily by amino acid composition. However, yeast prion domains are generally lacking in the bulky hydrophobic residues most strongly associated with amyloid formation and are instead enriched in glutamines and asparagines. Glutamine/asparagine-rich domains are thought to be involved in both disease-related and beneficial amyloid formation. These domains are overrepresented in eukaryotic genomes, but predictive methods have not yet been developed to efficiently distinguish between prion and nonprion glutamine/asparagine-rich domains. We have developed a novel in vivo assay to quantitatively assess how composition affects prion formation. Using our results, we have defined the compositional features that promote prion formation, allowing us to accurately distinguish between glutamine/asparagine-rich domains that can form prion-like aggregates and those that cannot. Additionally, our results explain why traditional amyloid prediction algorithms fail to accurately predict amyloid formation by the glutamine/asparagine-rich yeast prion domains.},

Thermotolerance relies on the ability of Hsp104 to cooperate with the Hsp70 chaperone system in the reactivation of heat-aggregated proteins. Prion propagation requires the Hsp104-dependent fragmentation of prion fibrils to create infectious seeds. It remained elusive whether both processes rely on common or different activities of Hsp104. Specifically, protein reactivation has been suggested to require a substrate threading activity of Hsp104 whereas fibril fragmentation may be mediated by a crowbar activity. Here we engineered an Hsp104 variant, HAP, which cooperates with the bacterial peptidase ClpP to form a novel proteolytic system. HAP threads aggregated model substrates as well as the yeast prion Sup35 through its central pore into associated ClpP. HAP variants that harbour a reduced threading activity were affected in both protein disaggregation and prion propagation, demonstrating that substrate threading represents the common mechanism for the processing of both substrate classes.},

abstract = {Evolution depends on the manner in which genetic variation is translated into new phenotypes. There has been much debate about whether organisms might have specific mechanisms for "evolvability," which would generate heritable phenotypic variation with adaptive value and could act to enhance the rate of evolution. Capacitor systems, which allow the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation and release it under stressful conditions, might provide such a mechanism. In yeast, the prion [PSI(+)] exposes a large array of previously hidden genetic variation, and the phenotypes it thereby produces are advantageous roughly 25{\%} of the time. The notion that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism for evolvability would be strengthened if the frequency of its appearance increased with stress. That is, a system that mediates even the haphazard appearance of new phenotypes, which have a reasonable chance of adaptive value would be beneficial if it were deployed at times when the organism is not well adapted to its environment. In an unbiased, high-throughput, genome-wide screen for factors that modify the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction, signal transducers and stress response genes were particularly prominent. Furthermore, prion induction increased by as much as 60-fold when cells were exposed to various stressful conditions, such as oxidative stress (H2O2) or high salt concentrations. The severity of stress and the frequency of [PSI(+)] induction were highly correlated. These findings support the hypothesis that [PSI(+)] is a mechanism to increase survival in fluctuating environments and might function as a capacitor to promote evolvability.},

abstract = {Self-templating amyloid forms of Sup35 constitute the yeast prion [PSI(+)]. How the protein-remodelling factor, Hsp104, collaborates with other chaperones to regulate [PSI(+)] inheritance remains poorly delineated. Here, we report how the Ssa and Ssb components of the Hsp70 chaperone system directly affect Sup35 prionogenesis and cooperate with Hsp104. We identify the ribosome-associated Ssb1:Zuo1:Ssz1 complex as a potent antagonist of Sup35 prionogenesis. The Hsp40 chaperones, Sis1 and Ydj1, preferentially interact with Sup35 oligomers and fibres compared with monomers, and facilitate Ssa1 and Ssb1 binding. Various Hsp70:Hsp40 pairs block prion nucleation by disassembling molten oligomers and binding mature oligomers. By binding fibres, Hsp70:Hsp40 pairs occlude prion recognition elements and inhibit seeded assembly. These inhibitory activities are partially relieved by the nucleotide exchange factor, Fes1. Low levels of Hsp104 stimulate prionogenesis and alleviate inhibition by some Hsp70:Hsp40 pairs. At high concentrations, Hsp104 eliminates Sup35 prions. This activity is reduced when Ssa1, or enhanced when Ssb1, is incorporated into nascent prions. These findings illuminate several facets of the chaperone interplay that underpins [PSI(+)] inheritance.},

abstract = {The cytosolic chaperone network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is intimately associated with the emergence and maintenance of prion traits. Recently, the Hsp110 protein, Sse1, has been identified as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for both cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone family members, Ssa1 and Ssb1. We have investigated the role of Sse1 in the de novo formation and propagation of [PSI(+)], the prion form of the translation termination factor, Sup35. As observed by others, we find that Sse1 is essential for efficient prion propagation. Our results suggest that the NEF activity is required for maintaining sufficient levels of substrate-free Ssa1. However, Sse1 exhibits an additional NEF-independent activity; it stimulates in vitro nucleation of Sup35NM, the prion domain of Sup35. We also observe that high levels of Sse1, but not of an unrelated NEF, very potently inhibit Hsp104-mediated curing of [PSI(+)]. Taken together, these results suggest a chaperone-like activity of Sse1 that assists in stabilization of early folding intermediates of the Sup35 prion conformation. This activity is not essential for prion formation under conditions of Sup35 overproduction, however, it may be relevant for spontaneous [PSI(+)] formation as well as for protection of the prion trait upon physiological Hsp104 induction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PRNP gene account for {\~{}}15{\%} of all prion disease cases. Little is understood about the mechanism of how some of these mutations in PRNP cause the protein to aggregate into amyloid fibers or cause disease. We have taken advantage of a chimeric protein system to study the oligopeptide repeat domain (ORD) expansions of the prion protein, PrP, and their effect on protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. We replaced the ORD of the yeast prion protein Sup35p with that from wild type and expanded ORDs of PrP and compared their biochemical properties in vitro. We previously determined that these chimeric proteins maintain the [PSI+] yeast prion phenotype in vivo. Interestingly, we noted that the repeat expanded chimeric prions seemed to be able to maintain a stronger strain of [PSI+] and convert from [psi-] to [PSI+] with a much higher frequency. In this study we have attempted to understand the biochemical properties of these chimeric proteins and to establish a system to study the properties of the ORD of PrP both in vivo and in vitro.

RESULTS: Investigation of the chimeric proteins in vitro reveals that repeat-expansions increase aggregation propensity and that the kinetics of fiber formation depends on the number of repeats. The fiber formation reactions are promiscuous in that the chimeric protein containing 14 repeats can readily cross-seed fiber formation of proteins that have the wild type number of repeats. Morphologically, the amyloid fibers formed by repeat-expanded proteins associate with each other to form large clumps that were not as prevalent in fibers formed by proteins containing the wild type number of repeats. Despite the increased aggregation propensity and lateral association of the repeat expanded proteins, there was no corresponding increase in the stability of the fibers formed. Therefore, we predict that the differences in fibers formed with different repeat lengths may not be due to gross changes in the amyloid core.

CONCLUSION: The biochemical observations presented here explain the properties of these chimeric proteins previously observed in yeast. More importantly, they suggest a mechanism for the observed correlation between age of onset and disease severity with respect to the length of the ORD in humans.},

abstract = {In yeast, fragmentation of amyloid polymers by the Hsp104 chaperone allows them to propagate as prions. The prion-forming domain of the yeast Sup35 protein is rich in glutamine, asparagine, tyrosine, and glycine residues, which may define its prion properties. Long polyglutamine stretches can also drive amyloid polymerization in yeast, but these polymers are unable to propagate because of poor fragmentation and exist through constant seeding with the Rnq1 prion polymers. We proposed that fragmentation of polyglutamine amyloids may be improved by incorporation of hydrophobic amino acid residues into polyglutamine stretches. To investigate this, we constructed sets of polyglutamine with or without tyrosine stretches fused to the non-prion domains of Sup35. Polymerization of these chimeras started rapidly, and its efficiency increased with stretch size. Polymerization of proteins with polyglutamine stretches shorter than 70 residues required Rnq1 prion seeds. Proteins with longer stretches polymerized independently of Rnq1 and thus could propagate. The presence of tyrosines within polyglutamine stretches dramatically enhanced polymer fragmentation and allowed polymer propagation in the absence of Rnq1 and, in some cases, of Hsp104.},

abstract = {Amyloid polymorphism underlies the prion strain phenomenon where a single protein polypeptide adopts different chain-folding patterns to form self-propagating cross-beta structures. Three strains of the yeast prion [PSI], namely [VH], [VK], and [VL], have been previously characterized and are amyloid conformers of the yeast translation termination factor Sup35. Here we define specific sequences of the Sup35 protein that are necessary for in vivo propagation of each of these prion strains. By sequential substitution of residues 5-55 of Sup35 by proline and insertion of glycine at alternate sites in this segment, specific mutations have been identified that interfere selectively with the propagation of each of the three prion strains in yeast: the [VH] strain requires amino acid residues 7-21; [VK] requires residues 9-37; and [VL] requires residues 5 to at least 52. Minimal polypeptide segments capable of encoding prion conformations were defined by assembly of recombinant Sup35 fragments on purified prion nuclei to form amyloid fibers in vitro, whose infectivity was assayed in yeast. For the [VK] and [VL] strains, the minimal fragments approximately coincide with the strain-specific sequences defined by mutations of the N-terminal portion of the intact Sup35 (1-685); and for the [VH] strain, a longer Sup (1-53) fragment is required. Polymorphic structures of other amyloids might similarly involve different stretches of polypeptides to form cross-beta amyloid cores with distinct molecular recognition surfaces.},

abstract = {Among the many surprises to arise from studies of prion biology, perhaps the most unexpected is the strain phenomenon whereby a single protein can misfold into structurally distinct, infectious states that cause distinguishable phenotypes. Similarly, proteins can adopt a spectrum of conformations in non-infectious diseases of protein folding; some are toxic and others are well tolerated. However, our understanding of the structural differences underlying prion strains and how these differences alter their physiological impact remains limited. Here we use a combination of solution NMR, amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and mutagenesis to study the structural differences between two strain conformations, termed Sc4 and Sc37 (ref. 5), of the yeast Sup35 prion. We find that these two strains have an overlapping amyloid core spanning most of the Gln/Asn-rich first 40 amino acids that is highly protected from H/D exchange and very sensitive to mutation. These features indicate that the cores are composed of tightly packed beta-sheets possibly resembling 'steric zipper' structures revealed by X-ray crystallography of Sup35-derived peptides. The stable structure is greatly expanded in the Sc37 conformation to encompass the first 70 amino acids, revealing why this strain shows increased fibre stability and decreased ability to undergo chaperone-mediated replication. Our findings establish that prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences and provide a structural basis for understanding a broad range of functional studies, including how conformational changes alter the physiological impact of prion strains.},

The abilities of prions to replicate, form structurally distinct strains, and establish and overcome transmission barriers between species are poorly understood. We exploit surface-bound peptides to overcome complexities of investigating such problems in solution. For the yeast prion Sup35, we find that the switch to the prion state is controlled with exquisite specificity by small elements of primary sequence. Strikingly, these same sequence elements govern the formation of distinct self-perpetuating conformations (prion strains) and determine species-specific seeding activities. A Sup35 chimaera that traverses the transmission barrier between two yeast species possesses the critical sequence elements from both. Using this chimaera, we show that the influence of environment and mutations on the formation of species-specific strains is driven by selective recognition of either sequence element. Thus, critical aspects of prion conversion are enciphered by subtle differences between small, highly specific recognition elements.},

abstract = {Mammalian prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders dependent on the prion protein PrP. Expansion of the oligopeptide repeats (ORE) found in PrP is associated with inherited prion diseases. Patients with ORE frequently harbor PrP aggregates, but other factors may contribute to pathology, as they often present with unexplained phenotypic variability. We created chimeric yeast-mammalian prion proteins to examine the influence of the PrP ORE on prion properties in yeast. Remarkably, all chimeric proteins maintained prion characteristics. The largest repeat expansion chimera displayed a higher propensity to maintain a self-propagating aggregated state. Strikingly, the repeat expansion conferred increased conformational flexibility, as observed by enhanced phenotypic variation. Furthermore, the repeat expansion chimera displayed an increased rate of prion conversion, but only in the presence of another aggregate, the [RNQ+] prion. We suggest that the PrP ORE increases the conformational flexibility of the prion protein, thereby enhancing the formation of multiple distinct aggregate structures and allowing more frequent prion conversion. Both of these characteristics may contribute to the phenotypic variability associated with PrP repeat expansion diseases.},

abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI(+)] represents an aggregated state of the translation termination factor Sup35 resulting in the tendency of ribosomes to readthrough stop codons. In this study, we constructed an auxotrophic chromosomal marker, ura3-197 (nonsense allele), applicable to selection for loss of [PSI(+)] to [psi(-)]. Unlike [psi(-)] yeast strains, [PSI(+)] yeast strains exhibit nonsense suppression of the ura3-197 allele and are not viable in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) that is converted to a toxic material by the readthrough product of Ura3. We selected 20 5-FOA-resistant, loss-of-[PSI(+)], mutants spontaneously or by transposon-mediated mutagenesis from ura3-197[PSI(+)] cells. All of the 20 [psi(-)] isolates were affected in Hsp104, a protein-remodelling factor. Although most of them were disabled in a normal Hsp104 function for thermotolerance, three single mutants, L462R, P557L and D704N, remained thermotolerant. Importantly, L462R and D704N also eliminate other yeast prions [URE3] and [PIN(+)], while P557L does not, suggesting that Hsp104 harbours a unique activity to prion propagation independent of its function in thermotolerance. The mutations that are specific to prion propagation are clustered around the lateral channel of the Hsp104 hexamer, suggesting a crucial and specific role of this channel for prion propagation.},

abstract = {The evolution of trichromatic color vision in primates may improve foraging performance as well as intraspecific communication; however, the context in which color vision initially evolved is unknown. We statistically examined the hypothesis that trichromatic color vision in primates represents a preexisting bias for the evolution of red coloration (pelage and/or skin) through sexual selection. Our analyses show that trichromatic color vision evolved before red pelage and red skin, as well as before gregarious mating systems that would promote sexual selection for visual traits and other forms of intraspecific communication via red traits. We also determined that both red pelage and red skin were more likely to evolve in the presence of color vision and mating systems that promote sexual selection. These results provide statistical support for the hypothesis that trichromatic color vision in primates evolved in a context other than intraspecific communication with red traits, most likely foraging performance, but, once evolved, represented a preexisting bias that promoted the evolution of red traits through sexual selection.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are a group of non-Mendelian genetic elements transmitted as altered and self-propagating conformations. Extensive studies in the last decade have provided valuable information on the mechanisms responsible for yeast prion propagation. How yeast prions are formed de novo and what cellular factors are required for determining prion "strains" or variants--a single polypeptide capable of existing in multiple conformations to result in distinct heritable phenotypes--continue to defy our understanding. We report here that Sse1, the yeast ortholog of the mammalian heat-shock protein 110 (Hsp110) and a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70 proteins, plays an important role in regulating [PSI+] de novo formation and variant determination. Overproduction of the Sse1 chaperone dramatically enhanced [PSI+] formation whereas deletion of SSE1 severely inhibited it. Only an unstable weak [PSI+] variant was formed in SSE1 disrupted cells whereas [PSI+] variants ranging from very strong to very weak were formed in isogenic wild-type cells under identical conditions. Thus, Sse1 is essential for the generation of multiple [PSI+] variants. Mutational analysis further demonstrated that the physical association of Sse1 with Hsp70 but not the ATP hydrolysis activity of Sse1 is required for the formation of multiple [PSI+] variants. Our findings establish a novel role for Sse1 in [PSI+] de novo formation and variant determination, implying that the mammalian Hsp110 may likewise be involved in the etiology of protein-folding diseases.},

@article{Allen2007,
abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI+] is a self-propagating amyloidogenic isoform of the translation termination factor Sup35. Overproduction of the chaperone protein Hsp104 results in loss of [PSI+]. Here we demonstrate that this effect is decreased by deletion of either the gene coding for one of the major yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc4, or the gene coding for the ubiquitin-recycling enzyme, Ubp6. The effect of ubc4Delta on [PSI+] loss was increased by depletion of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssb but was not influenced by depletion of Ubp6. This indicates that Ubc4 affects [PSI+] loss via a pathway that is the same as the one affected by Ubp6 but not by Ssb. In the presence of Rnq1 protein, ubc4Delta also facilitates spontaneous de novo formation of [PSI+]. This stimulation is independent of [PIN+], the prion isoform of Rnq1. Numerous attempts failed to detect ubiquitinated Sup35 in the yeast extracts. While ubc4Delta and other alterations of ubiquitin system used in this work cause slight induction of some Hsps, these changes are insufficient to explain their effect on [PSI+]. However, ubc4Delta increases the proportion of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa bound to Sup35, suggesting that misfolded Sup35 is either more abundant or more accessible to the chaperones in the absence of Ubc4. The proportion of [PSI+] cells containing large aggregated Sup35 structures is also increased by ubc4Delta. We propose that UPS alterations induce an adaptive response, resulting in accumulation of the large "aggresome"-like aggregates that promote de novo prion generation and prion recovery from the chaperone treatment.},

abstract = {Protein conformational diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, affect a large portion of our aging population. Cells have evolved mechanisms for rescuing and recycling misfolded proteins, but these systems are not perfect. Chaperones can rescue misfolded proteins by breaking up aggregates and assisting in the refolding process. Proteins that cannot be rescued by refolding can be delivered to the proteasome by chaperones to be recycled. One class of 'misfolded' proteins, prions, appears to evade detection by this machinery and persist in a misfolded state. In fact, it seems that the prions usurp the refolding machinery and actually employ chaperones to propagate the prion state. Recent data has begun to uncover the mechanism behind this unique relationship.},

@article{Tanaka2006,
abstract = {A principle that has emerged from studies of protein aggregation is that proteins typically can misfold into a range of different aggregated forms. Moreover, the phenotypic and pathological consequences of protein aggregation depend critically on the specific misfolded form. A striking example of this is the prion strain phenomenon, in which prion particles composed of the same protein cause distinct heritable states. Accumulating evidence from yeast prions such as [PSI+] and mammalian prions argues that differences in the prion conformation underlie prion strain variants. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood why changes in the conformation of misfolded proteins alter their physiological effects. Here we present and experimentally validate an analytical model describing how [PSI+] strain phenotypes arise from the dynamic interaction among the effects of prion dilution, competition for a limited pool of soluble protein, and conformation-dependent differences in prion growth and division rates. Analysis of three distinct prion conformations of yeast Sup35 (the [PSI+] protein determinant) and their in vivo phenotypes reveals that the Sup35 amyloid causing the strongest phenotype surprisingly shows the slowest growth. This slow growth, however, is more than compensated for by an increased brittleness that promotes prion division. The propensity of aggregates to undergo breakage, thereby generating new seeds, probably represents a key determinant of their physiological impact for both infectious (prion) and non-infectious amyloids.},

Measurements of magnetic dipole-dipole couplings among (13)C nuclei in a series of Sup35NM fibril samples, (13)C-labeled at backbone carbonyl sites of Tyr, Leu, or Phe residues or at side-chain methyl sites of Ala residues, indicate intermolecular (13)C-(13)C distances of approximately 0.5 nm for nearly all sites in the N domain. Certain sites in the M domain also exhibit intermolecular distances of approximately 0.5 nm.

Currently, no treatment for prion-based diseases is available. Recently we have developed a rapid, yeast-based, two-step assay to screen for anti-prion drugs [1]. This new method allowed us to identify several compounds that are effective in vivo against budding yeast [PSI+] and [URE3] prions but also able to promote mammalian prion clearance in three different cell culture-based assays. Taken together, these results validate our method as an economic and efficient high-throughput screening approach to identify novel prion inhibitors or to carry on comprehensive structure-activity studies for already isolated anti-mammalian prion drugs. These results suggest furthermore that biochemical pathways controlling prion formation and/or maintenance are conserved from yeast to human and thus amenable to pharmacological and genetic analysis. Finally, it would be very interesting to test active drugs isolated using the yeast-based assay in models for other diseases (neurodegenerative or not) involving amyloid fibers like Huntington's, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases.},

abstract = {Yeast prions are non-Mendelian genetic elements that are conferred by altered and self-propagating protein conformations. Such a protein conformation-based transmission is similar to that of PrP(Sc), the infectious protein responsible for prion diseases. Despite recent progress in understanding the molecular nature and epigenetic transmission of prions, the underlying mechanisms governing prion conformational switch and determining prion "strains" are not understood. We report here that the evolutionarily conserved heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) strongly influences yeast prion formation and strain determination. An hsf1 mutant lacking the amino-terminal activation domain inhibits the yeast prion [PSI+] formation whereas a mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal activation domain promotes [PSI+] formation. Moreover, specific [PSI+] strains are preferentially formed in these mutants, demonstrating the importance of genetic makeup in determining de novo appearance of prion strains. Although these hsf1 mutants preferentially support the formation of certain [PSI+] strains, they are capable of receiving and faithfully propagating nonpreferable strains, suggesting that prion initiation and propagation are distinct processes requiring different cellular components. Our findings establish the importance of HSF in prion initiation and strain determination and imply a similar regulatory role of mammalian HSFs in the complex etiology of prion disease.},

abstract = {Common methods to identify yeast cells containing the prion form of the Sup35 translation termination factor, [PSI+], involve a nonsense suppressor phenotype. Decreased function of Sup35p in [PSI+] cells leads to read-through of certain nonsense mutations in a few auxotrophic markers, e.g. ade1-14. This read-through results in growth on adenine-deficient media. While this powerful tool has dramatically facilitated the study of [PSI+], it is limited to a narrow range of laboratory strains and cannot easily be used to screen for cells that have lost the [PSI+] prion. Therefore we have engineered a nonsense mutation in the widely used URA3 gene, termed the ura3-14 allele. Introduction of the ura3-14 allele into an array of genetic backgrounds, carrying a loss-of-function URA3 mutation and [PSI+], allows for growth on media lacking uracil, indicative of decreased translational termination efficiency. This ura3-14 allele is able to distinguish various forms of the [PSI+] prion, called variants, and is able to detect the de novo appearance of [PSI+] in strains carrying the prion form of Rnq1p, [PIN+]. Furthermore, 5-fluoroorotic acid, which kills cells making functional Ura3p, provides a means to select for [psi-] derivatives in a population of [PSI+] cells marked with the ura3-14 allele, making this system much more versatile than previous methods.},

abstract = {Hsp104 is a hexameric protein chaperone that resolubilizes stress-damaged proteins from aggregates. Hsp104 promotes [PSI(+)] prion propagation by breaking prion aggregates, which propagate as amyloid fibers, into more numerous prion "seeds." Inactivating Hsp104 cures cells of [PSI(+)] and other amyloid-like yeast prions. Overexpressing Hsp104 also eliminates [PSI(+)], presumably by completely resolubilizing prion aggregates. Inexplicably, however, excess Hsp104 does not cure the other prions. Here we identify missense mutations in Hsp104's amino-terminal domain (NTD), which is conserved among Hsp100 proteins but whose function is unknown, that improve [PSI(+)] propagation. Hsp104Delta147, engineered to lack the NTD, supported [PSI(+)] and functioned normally in thermotolerance and protein disaggregation. Hsp104Delta147 failed to cure [PSI(+)] when overexpressed, however, implying that excess Hsp104 does not eliminate [PSI(+)] by direct dissolution of prion aggregates. Curing of [PSI(+)] by overexpressing catalytically inactive Hsp104 (Hsp104KT), which interferes with endogenous Hsp104, did not require the NTD. We further found that Hsp104 mutants defective in threading peptides through the hexamer pore had reduced ability to support [PSI(+)] in proportion to protein resolubilization defects, suggesting that [PSI(+)] propagation depends on this threading and that Hsp104 "breaks" prion aggregates by extracting protein monomers from the amyloid fibers.},

abstract = {The cytoplasmic [PSI(+)] element of budding yeast represents the prion conformation of translation release factor Sup35. Much interest lies in understanding how prions are able to generate variation in isogenic strains. Recent observations suggest that a single prion domain, PrD, is able to adopt several conformations that account for prion strains. We report novel PrD variants of Sup35 that convert weak [PSI(+)] to strong [PSI(+)], and vice versa, upon transmission from wild-type Sup35. During the transmission from wild-type Sup35 to variant Sup35s, no conformational changes were detected by proteolytic fingerprinting and the original [PSI(+)] strain was remembered upon return to wild-type Sup35. These findings suggest that during transmission to variant Sup35s, the [PSI(+)] phenotype is variable while the original conformation is remembered. A mechanism of "conformational memory" to remember specific [PSI(+)] conformations during transmission is proposed.},

abstract = {In a variety of systems, proteins have been linked to processes historically limited to nucleic acids, such as infectivity and inheritance. These atypical proteins, termed prions, lack sequence homology but are collectively defined by their capacity to adopt multiple physical and therefore functional states in vivo. Newly synthesized prion protein generally adopts the form already present in the cell, and this in vivo folding bias directs the near faithful transmission of the corresponding phenotypic state. Switches between the prion and non-prion phenotypes can occur in vivo; however, the fate of existing protein during these transitions and its effects on the emergence of new traits remain major unanswered questions. Here, we determine the changes in protein-state that induce phenotypic switching for the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI(+)]. We show that the prion form does not need to be specified by an alternate misfolding pathway initiated during Sup35 synthesis but instead can be accessed by mature protein. This remodelling of protein from one stable form to another is accompanied by the loss of Sup35 activity, evoking a rapid change in cellular phenotype within a single cell cycle.},

abstract = {Many proteins can adopt self-propagating beta-sheet-rich structures, termed amyloid fibrils. The [URE3] and [PSI+] prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are infectious amyloid forms of the proteins Ure2p and Sup35p, respectively. Ure2p forms prions primarily as a result of its sequence composition, as versions of Ure2p with the prion domain amino acids shuffled are still able to form prions. Here we show that prion induction by both Ure2p and Ure2-21p, one of the scrambled versions of Ure2p, is clearly dependent on the length of the inducing fragment. For Ure2-21p, no single sequence is found in all of the inducing fragments, highlighting the sequence independence of prion formation. Furthermore, the sequence of the Sup35p prion domain can also be randomized without blocking prion formation. Indeed, a single shuffled sequence could give rise to several prion variants. These results suggest that [PSI+] formation is driven primarily by the amino acid composition of the Sup35p prion domain, and that the Sup35p oligopeptide repeats are not required for prion maintenance.},

abstract = {Numerous soluble proteins convert to insoluble amyloid-like fibrils that have common properties. Amyloid fibrils are associated with fatal diseases such as Alzheimer's, and amyloid-like fibrils can be formed in vitro. For the yeast protein Sup35, conversion to amyloid-like fibrils is associated with a transmissible infection akin to that caused by mammalian prions. A seven-residue peptide segment from Sup35 forms amyloid-like fibrils and closely related microcrystals, from which we have determined the atomic structure of the cross-beta spine. It is a double beta-sheet, with each sheet formed from parallel segments stacked in register. Side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper, bonding the sheets. Within each sheet, every segment is bound to its two neighbouring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds. The structure illuminates the stability of amyloid fibrils, their self-seeding characteristic and their tendency to form polymorphic structures.},

In contrast, the "selfish" 2mu DNA was in 38 wild strains and the selfish RNA replicons L-BC, 20S, and 23S were found in 8, 14, and 1 strains, respectively.

abstract = {Cryptic genetic variation accumulates under weakened selection and has been proposed as a source of evolutionary innovations. Weakened selection may, however, also lead to the accumulation of strongly deleterious or lethal alleles, swamping the effect of any potentially adaptive alleles when they are revealed. Here I model variation that is partially shielded from selection, assuming that unconditionally deleterious variation is more strongly deleterious than variation that is potentially adaptive in a future environment. I find that cryptic genetic variation can be substantially enriched for potential adaptations under a broad range of realistic parameter values, including those applicable to alternative splices and readthrough products generated by the yeast prion [PSI+]. This enrichment is dramatically stronger when multiple simultaneous changes are required to generate a potentially adaptive phenotype. Cryptic genetic variation is likely to be an effective source of useful adaptations at a time of environmental change, relative to an equivalent source of variation that has not spent time in a hidden state.},

abstract = {Genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified the roles of ribosome components, tRNAs and translation factors in translational fidelity. These screens rely on the suppression of altered start codons, nonsense codons or frameshift mutations in genes involved in amino acid or nucleotide metabolism. Many of these genes are regulated by the General Amino Acid Control (GAAC) pathway. Upon amino acid starvation, the kinase GCN2 induces the GAAC cascade via increased translation of the transcriptional activator GCN4 controlled by upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Overexpression of the GCN2 or GCN4 genes enhances the sensitivity of translation fidelity assays that utilize genes regulated by GCN4, such as the suppression of a +1 insertion by S.cerevisiae translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) mutants. Paromomycin and the prion [PSI+], which reduce translational fidelity, do not increase GCN4 expression to induce the suppression phenotype and in fact reduce derepression. eEF1A mutations that reduce translation, however, reduce expression of GCN4 under non-starvation conditions. These eEF1A mutants also reduce HIS4 mRNA expression. Taken together, this system improves in vivo strategies for the analysis of translational fidelity and further provides new information on the interplay among translation fidelity, altered elongation and translational control via uORFs.},

The simulation method at atomic resolution employs a new implementation of a Langevin dynamics "reaction path annealing" algorithm. The results indicate that the presence of amyloid-like cross-beta-sheet strands both facilitates the transition into the cross-beta conformation and substantially lowers the free energy barrier for this transition. This model systems allows us to investigate the energetic and kinetic details of this transition, which is consistent with an auto-catalyzed, nucleation-like mechanism for the formation of beta-amyloid. In particular, we find that electrostatic interactions of peptide backbone dipoles contribute significantly to the stability of the beta-amyloid state. Furthermore, we find water exclusion and interactions of polar side-chains to be driving forces of amyloid formation: the cross-beta conformation is stabilized by burial of polar side-chains and inter-residue hydrogen bonds in the presence of an amyloid-like "seed". These findings are in support of a "dry, polar zipper model" of amyloid formation.},

Despite intense research, the architecture and conformational conversion of amyloids remain poorly understood. Amyloid conformers of Sup35 are the molecular embodiment of the yeast prion known as [PSI], which produces heritable changes in phenotype through self-perpetuating changes in protein folding. Here we determine the nature of Sup35's cooperatively folded amyloid core, and use this information to investigate central questions in prion biology. Specific segments of the amyloid core form intermolecular contacts in a 'Head-to-Head', 'Tail-to-Tail' fashion, but the 'Central Core' is sequestered through intramolecular contacts. The Head acquires productive interactions first, and these nucleate assembly. Variations in the length of the amyloid core and the nature of intermolecular interfaces form the structural basis of distinct prion 'strains', which produce variant phenotypes in vivo. These findings resolve several problems in yeast prion biology and have broad implications for other amyloids.},

abstract = {[PSI(+)] is a prion isoform of the yeast release factor Sup35. In some assays, the cytosolic chaperones Ssa1 and Ssb1/2 of the Hsp70 family were previously shown to exhibit "pro-[PSI(+)]" and "anti-[PSI(+)]" effects, respectively. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that excess Ssa1 increases de novo formation of [PSI(+)] and that pro-[PSI(+)] effects of Ssa1 are shared by all other Ssa proteins. Experiments with chimeric constructs show that the peptide-binding domain is a major determinant of differences in the effects of Ssa and Ssb proteins on [PSI(+)]. Surprisingly, overproduction of either chaperone increases loss of [PSI(+)] when Sup35 is simultaneously overproduced. Excess Ssa increases both the average size of prion polymers and the proportion of monomeric Sup35 protein. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments uncover direct physical interactions between Sup35 and Hsp70 proteins. The proposed model postulates that Ssa stimulates prion formation and polymer growth by stabilizing misfolded proteins, which serve as substrates for prion conversion. In the case of very large prion aggregates, further increase in size may lead to the loss of prion activity. In contrast, Ssb either stimulates refolding into nonprion conformation or targets misfolded proteins for degradation, in this way counteracting prion formation and propagation.},

abstract = {Mass per length (mpl) measurements on single amyloid fibrils that specifically propagate the [VH], [VK], and [VL] strains of the yeast prion [PSI] reveal unanticipated differences in their structures. Many fibrils have approximately 1.0 prion molecule per 4.7-A cross-beta repeat period, which is consistent with a self-replicating model built by parallel beta-sheet hydrogen-bonding of like prion peptide segments, but other fibrils are definitely heavier. The predominantly straight fibrils of the dominant [VH] strain have a bimodal mpl distribution, corresponding to components with approximately 1.0 and 1.2 prions per repeat. Fibrils of the weaker [VK] strain, which are almost all wavy, have a monodisperse mpl distribution with a mean of 1.15 prions per repeat. The recessive [VL] strain sample has approximately 1.05 prions per repeat in single fibrils and includes approximately 10{\%} double fibrils, which are rare in the duplicate [VH] and [VK] samples. All of these samples were assembled from purified recombinant Sup35 prion protein by seeded growth on nuclei extracted from yeast bearing the three [PSI] strains. Infectious and noninfectious spontaneously assembled fibrils of the recombinant prion protein also display different heterogeneous morphologies. The strain-specific morphological differences we have observed directly confirm the structural prediction of the protein-only prion theory but do not have an obvious molecular explanation.},

abstract = {The [PSI+] prion determinant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes nonsense suppressor phenotype due to a reduced function of the translation termination factor Sup35 (eRF3) polymerized into amyloid fibrils. Prion state of the Rnq1 protein, [PIN+], is required for the [PSI+] de novo generation but not propagation. Yeast [psi-] [PIN+] cells overproducing Sup35 can exhibit nonsense suppression without generation of a stable [PSI+]. Here, we show that in such cells, most of Sup35 represents amyloid polymers, although the remaining Sup35 monomer is sufficient for normal translation termination. The presence of these polymers strictly depends on [PIN+], suggesting that their maintenance relies on efficient generation de novo rather than inheritance. Sup35 polymers contain Rnq1, confirming a hypothesis that Rnq1 polymers seed Sup35 polymerization. About 10{\%} of cells overproducing Sup35 form colonies on medium selective for suppression, which suggests that the proportion of Sup35 monomers to polymers varies between cells of transformants, allowing selection of cells deficient for soluble Sup35. A hybrid Sup35 with the N-terminal domain replaced for 66 glutamine residues also polymerizes and can cause nonsense suppression when overproduced. The described polymers of these proteins differ from the [PSI+] polymers by poor heritability and very high frequency of the de novo appearance, thus being more similar to amyloids than to prions.},

abstract = {Many proteins can misfold into beta-sheet-rich, self-seeding polymers (amyloids). Prions are exceptional among such aggregates in that they are also infectious. In fungi, prions are not pathogenic but rather act as epigenetic regulators of cell physiology, providing a powerful model for studying the mechanism of prion replication. We used prion-forming domains from two budding yeast proteins (Sup35p and New1p) to examine the requirements for prion formation and inheritance. In both proteins, a glutamine/asparagine-rich (Q/N-rich) tract mediates sequence-specific aggregation, while an adjacent motif, the oligopeptide repeat, is required for the replication and stable inheritance of these aggregates. Our findings help to explain why although Q/N-rich proteins are relatively common, few form heritable aggregates: prion inheritance requires both an aggregation sequence responsible for self-seeded growth and an element that permits chaperone-dependent replication of the aggregate. Using this knowledge, we have designed novel artificial prions by fusing the replication element of Sup35p to aggregation-prone sequences from other proteins, including pathogenically expanded polyglutamine.},

abstract = {The interaction of Hsp104 with yeast prion fibers made of Sup35NM, a prion-inducing domain of Sup35, was tested. When fluorescently labeled Hsp104 was added to the preformed fibers, individual fibers were fluorescently decorated uniformly along the fiber length. However, the density of fluorescence differed from one fiber to another, indicating the presence of subspecies of Sup35NM fibers. The time course of fiber formation from monomer Sup35NM was delayed by Hsp104. Hsp104-mediated fragmentation of fibers was tested using bead-tethered fibers. In contrast with the recent report (Shorter, J., and Lindquist, S. (2004) Science 304, 1793-1797), Hsp104 alone was unable to sever the fibers. Yeast cell lysate or the Hsp104-deficient cell lysate plus Hsp104 caused ATP-dependent, guanidine hydrochloride-sensitive fragmentation of the fibers. Thus, in our experimental setup, Hsp104 plus other factor(s) in the yeast cytosol are required for severing yeast prion fiber. The reason of discrepancy from the above report is unknown but is possibly caused by different conformational subspecies of prion fibers.},

abstract = {The molecular chaperone Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae dissolves protein aggregates in the cell and is thus of crucial importance for the thermotolerance of yeast. In addition to this disaggregase activity, Hsp104 has a key function in yeast prion propagation, as Hsp104 was found to be essential for the maintenance of the associated phenotypes. In vivo data suggest that Hsp104 function is affected by guanidinium chloride. Adding small amounts of this compound to yeast medium causes curing of the prions: cells lose their prion-related phenotype. Guanidinium chloride was also found to impair heat shock resistance. Here, we present a detailed in vitro analysis showing that guanidinium chloride is an uncompetitive inhibitor of Hsp104. Micromolar concentrations of this agent reduce the ATPase activity of Hsp104 to approximately 35{\%} of its normal activity. This inhibition is not related to the denaturing properties of this compound, because Hsp104 was not affected by urea. Guanidinium ions selectively bind to the nucleotide-bound, hexameric state of the molecular chaperone. Thus, they increase the affinity of Hsp104 for adenine nucleotides and promote the nucleotide-dependent oligomerization of the chaperone. Our findings strongly suggest that guanidinium chloride causes curing of yeast prions by perturbing the ATPase of Hsp104, which is essential for both prion propagation and thermotolerance.},

abstract = {Prions are infectious protein conformations that are generally ordered protein aggregates. In the absence of prions, newly synthesized molecules of these same proteins usually maintain a conventional soluble conformation. However, prions occasionally arise even without a homologous prion template. The conformational switch that results in the de novo appearance of yeast prions with glutamine/aspargine (Q/N)-rich prion domains (e.g., [PSI+]), is promoted by heterologous prions with a similar domain (e.g., [RNQ+], also known as [PIN+]), or by overexpression of proteins with prion-like Q-, N-, or Q/N-rich domains. This finding led to the hypothesis that aggregates of heterologous proteins provide an imperfect template on which the new prion is seeded. Indeed, we show that newly forming Sup35 and preexisting Rnq1 aggregates always colocalize when [PSI+] appearance is facilitated by the [RNQ+] prion, and that Rnq1 fibers enhance the in vitro formation of fibers by the prion domain of Sup35 (NM). The proteins do not however form mixed, interdigitated aggregates. We also demonstrate that aggregating variants of the polyQ-containing domain of huntingtin promote the de novo conversion of Sup35 into [PSI+]; whereas nonaggregating variants of huntingtin and aggregates of non-polyQ amyloidogenic proteins, transthyretin, alpha-synuclein, and synphilin do not. Furthermore, transthyretin and alpha-synuclein amyloids do not facilitate NM aggregation in vitro, even though in [PSI+] cells NM and transthyretin aggregates also occasionally colocalize. Our data, especially the in vitro reproduction of the highly specific heterologous seeding effect, provide strong support for the hypothesis of cross-seeding in the spontaneous initiation of prion states.},

abstract = {Abundant nonfibrillar oligomeric intermediates are a common feature of amyloid formation, and these oligomers, rather than the final fibers, have been suggested to be the toxic species in some amyloid diseases. Whether such oligomers are critical intermediates for fiber assembly or form in an alternate, potentially separable pathway, however, remains unclear. Here we study the polymerization of the amyloidogenic yeast prion protein Sup35. Rapid polymerization occurs in the absence of observable intermediates, and both targeted kinetic and direct single-molecule fluorescence measurements indicate that fibers grow by monomer addition. A three-step model (nucleation, monomer addition, and fiber fragmentation) accurately accounts for the distinctive kinetic features of amyloid formation, including weak concentration dependence, acceleration by agitation, and sigmoidal shape of the polymerization time course. Thus, amyloid growth can occur by monomer addition in a reaction distinct from and competitive with formation of potentially toxic oligomeric intermediates.},

In cells with both [PSI+] and [PIN+] the two prions formed separate structures at both levels. Also, the destabilization of [PSI+] by certain [PIN+] variants was shown not to involve alterations in the [PSI+] prion size.

abstract = {A self-perpetuating change in the conformation of the translation termination factor Sup35p is the basis for the prion [PSI+], a protein-based genetic element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a process closely allied to in vivo conversion, the purified soluble, prion-determining region of Sup35p (NM) converts to amyloid fibers by means of nucleated conformational conversion. First, oligomeric species convert to nuclei, and these nuclei then promote polymerization of soluble protein into amyloid fibers. To elucidate the nature of the polymerization step, we created single-cysteine substitution mutants at different positions in NM to provide unique attachment sites for various probes. In vivo, the mutants behaved like wild-type protein in both the [psi-] and [PSI+] states. In vitro, they assembled with wild-type kinetics and formed fibers with the same morphologies. When labeled with fluorescent probes, two mutants, NMT158C and NME167C, exhibited a change in fluorescence coincident with amyloid assembly. These mutants provided a sensitive measure for the kinetics of fiber elongation, and the lag phase in conversion. The cysteine in the mutant NMK184C remained exposed after assembly. When labeled with biotin and bound to streptavidin beads, it was used to capture radiolabeled soluble NM in the process of conversion. This process established the existence of a detergent-susceptible intermediate in fiber elongation. Thus, the second stage of nucleated conformational conversion, fiber elongation, itself contains at least two steps: the association of soluble protein with preformed fibers to form an assembly intermediate, followed by conformational conversion into amyloid.},

The properties of yeast prions are studied in the hope that this will enhance the understanding of mammalian prions, which cause mad-cow, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and related neurodegenerative diseases. When host cells divide, the yeast prions distribute themselves without loss over the daughter cells. Experimental data provide information on how the proportion of cells with prions decreases over time when priori replication is inhibited. One feature of scientific interest is the unknown mean number, n0, of prions assumed to be present in the cells at the start of the experiment. We develop several stochastic models and by fitting them to the data, we obtain substantially larger estimates of n0 compared with a previous analysis. An interesting feature of a model with constant cell generation times is that the predicted proportion of cells with prions varies over time as a sequence of linked hyperbolic curves. Avenues for future research are outlined, which relax simplifying assumptions made in the models. We make several recommendations for the design of future experiments.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae's ability to form the prion [PSI+] may increase the rate of evolvability, defined as the rate of appearance of heritable and potentially adaptive phenotypic variants. The increase in evolvability occurs when the appearance of the prion causes read-through translation and reveals hidden variation in untranslated regions. Eventually the portion of the phenotypic variation that is adaptive loses its dependence on the revealing mechanism. The mechanism is reversible, so the restoration of normal translation termination conceals the revealed deleterious variation, leaving the yeast without a permanent handicap. Given that the ability to form [PSI+] is known to be fixed and conserved in yeast, we construct a mathematical model to calculate whether this ability is more likely to have become fixed due to chance alone or due to its evolvability characteristics. We find that evolvability is a more likely explanation, as long as environmental change makes partial read-through of stop codons adaptive at a frequency of at least once every million years.},

abstract = {Yeast Ssb proteins (Ssbp) are ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperones that function in translation. Elevated levels of Ssbp enhance the ability of over-expressed Hsp104 chaperone to eliminate the yeast [PSI+] prion, while depletion of Ssbp reduces this effect. Millimolar concentrations of guanidine in the growth medium cure yeast cells of prions by inactivating Hsp104. Guanidine is also toxic to yeast, irrespective of the status of Hsp104 and [PSI+]. Strains that lack Ssbp are hypersensitive to guanidine toxicity. Here we show that ssb- cells have normal numbers of [PSI+] "seeds", but can be cured of [PSI+] using one-sixth of the guanidine concentration required to eliminate [PSI+] from SSB cells. Correspondingly, the level of intracellular guanidine was eight-fold higher in ssb- cells than in wild-type cells, which explains all effects of Ssbp depletion on susceptibility to guanidine. The sensitivity of wild-type cells to the effects of guanidine also correlated with guanidine uptake, which was enhanced at low temperature. Guanidine sensitivity of strains mutated in any of 16 ABC membrane transporters, which are implicated in multidrug resistance, was normal. We found that an erg6 mutant that has an altered membrane lipid composition was hypersensitive to guanidine toxicity, but the lipid composition of ssb- cells was identical to that of wild-type cells. Our results suggest that Ssbp depletion does not affect prion seed regeneration, and that elevated guanidine uptake by ssb- cells may be due to increased retention rather than to an alteration in active or passive transport of the compound.},

abstract = {The propagation of the prion form of the yeast Sup35p protein, the so-called [PSI(+)] determinant, involves the generation and partition of a small number of particulate determinants that we propose calling "propagons." The numbers of propagons in [PSI(+)] cells can be inferred from the kinetics of elimination of [PSI(+)] during growth in the presence of a low concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Using this and an alternative method of counting the numbers of propagons, we demonstrate considerable clonal variation in the apparent numbers of propagons between different [PSI(+)] yeast strains, between different cultures of the same [PSI(+)] yeast strain, and between different cells of the same [PSI(+)] culture. We provide further evidence that propagon generation is blocked by growth in GdnHCl and that it is largely confined to the S phase of the cell cycle. In addition, we show that at low propagon number there is a bias toward retention of propagons in mother cells and that production of new propagons is very rapid when cells with depleted numbers of propagons are rescued into normal growth medium. The implications of our findings with respect to yeast prion propagation mechanisms are discussed.},

abstract = {Mutation of the mouse Usp14 gene, encoding the homolog of yeast deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6, causes ataxia. Here we show that deletion of the UBP6 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes sensitivity to a broad range of toxic compounds and antagonizes phenotypic expression and de novo induction of the yeast prion [PSI+], a functionally defective self-perpetuating isoform of the translation termination factor Sup35. Conversely, overexpression of ubiquitin (Ub) increases phenotypic expression and induction of [PSI+] in the wild type cells and suppresses all tested ubp6Delta defects, indicating that they are primarily due to depletion of cellular Ub levels. Several lines of evidence suggest that Ubp6 functions on the proteasome. First, Ub levels in the ubp6Delta cells can be partly restored by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that deletion of Ubp6 decreases Ub levels by increasing proteasome-dependent degradation of Ub. Second, fluorescence microscopy analysis shows that Ubp6-GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus of yeast cell, as are most proteasomes. Third, the N-terminal Ub-like domain, although it is not required for nuclear localization of Ubp6, targets Ubp6 to the proteasome and cannot be functionally replaced by Ub. The human ortholog of Ubp6, USP14, probably plays a similar role in higher eukaryotes, since it fully compensates for ubp6Delta defects and binds to the yeast proteasome. These data link the Ub system to prion expression and propagation and have broad implications for other neuronal inclusion body diseases.},

abstract = {The Sup35p protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential translation factor whose prion-like properties give rise to the non-Mendelian genetic element [PSI(+)]. In this study the SUP35 gene from the related yeast species Candida albicans has been characterized. The CaSUP35 gene encodes a protein (CaSup35p) of 729 aa which shows 65{\%} amino acid identity to the S. cerevisiae Sup35p protein (ScSup35p), with the C-terminal region showing greater identity (79{\%}) than the N-terminal region. The full-length CaSup35p can functionally replace ScSup35p in S. cerevisiae although complementation is only complete when CaSup35p is overexpressed. Complementation only requires expression of the CaSup35p C domain. In S. cerevisiae the full-length CaSup35p is unable to establish a prion-like aggregated state even in the presence of endogenous ScSup35p prion 'seeds', thus confirming the existence of a species barrier in fungal prion propagation. Subcellular localization studies in C. albicans show that although CaSup35p is normally ribosome-associated, when not ribosome-associated, it does not form pelletable high-molecular-mass aggregates characteristic of the ScSup35p in [PSI(+)] strains. Unlike the ScSup35p, the CaSup35p N domain contains a number of polyglutamine repeats although it does contain seven copies of the peptide GGYQQ that is repeated in the ScSup35p N domain. Analysis of the CaSUP35 gene from 14 different strains of C. albicans identified four naturally occurring polymorphisms associated with changes in the length of the largest of the polyglutamine repeats. These findings have important implications for the evolution of fungal prion genes.},

abstract = {The exon-1 peptide of huntingtin has 51 Gln repeats and produces the symptoms of Huntington's disease in transgenic mice. Aggregation of the yeast Sup35 protein into prions has been attributed to its glutamine-rich and asparagine-rich domain. Here, we show that poly-L-asparagine forms polar zippers similar to those of poly-L-glutamine. In solution at acid pH, the glutamine-rich and asparagine-rich 18-residue Sup35 peptide, rendered soluble by the addition of two aspartates at the amino end and two lysines at the carboxyl end, gives a beta-sheet CD spectrum; it aggregates at neutral pH. A poly-alanine peptide D(2)A(10)K(2) gives an alpha-helical CD spectrum at all pHs and does not aggregate; a peptide with the sequence of the C-terminal helix of the alpha-chain of human hemoglobin, preceded by two aspartates and followed by two lysines, exhibits a random coil spectrum and does not aggregate either. Alignment of several beta-strands with the sequence of the 42-residue Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide shows that they can be linked together by a network of salt bridges. We also asked why single amino acid replacements can so destabilize the native structures of proteins that they unfold and form amyloids. The difference in free energy of a protein molecule between its native, fully ordered structure and an amorphous mixture of randomly coiled chains is only of the order of 10 kcal/mol. Theory shows that destabilization of the native structure by no more than 2 kcal/mol can increase the probability of nucleation of disordered aggregates from which amyloids could grow 130,000-fold.},

abstract = {The yeast prion [PSI(+)] provides an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of new phenotypes through self-perpetuating changes in protein conformation. [PSI(+)] is a nonfunctional, ordered aggregate of the translation termination factor Sup35p that influences new Sup35 proteins to adopt the same state. The N-terminal region of Sup35p plays a central role in prion induction and propagation. The C-terminal region provides translation termination activity. The function of the highly charged, conformationally flexible middle region (M) is unknown. An M deletion mutant was capable of existing in either the prion or the nonprion state, but in either case it was mostly insoluble. Substituting a charged synthetic polypeptide for M restored solubility, but the prions formed by this variant were mitotically very unstable. Substituting charged flexible regions from two other proteins for M created variants that acquired prion states (defined as self-perpetuating changes in function transferred to them from wild-type [PSI(+)] elements), but had profoundly different properties. One was soluble in both the prion and the nonprion form, mitotically stable but meiotically unstable, and cured by guanidine HCl but not by alterations in heat shock protein 104 (Hsp104p). The other could only maintain the prion state in the presence of wild-type protein, producing Mendelian segregation patterns. The unique character of these M variants, all carrying the same N-terminal prion-determining region, demonstrate the importance of M for [PSI(+)] and suggest that a much wider range of epigenetic phenomena might be based on self-perpetuating, prion-like changes in protein conformation than suggested by our current methods for defining prion states.},

abstract = {Inactivation of Hsp104 by guanidine is contended to be the mechanism by which guanidine cures yeast prions. We now find an Hsp104 mutation (D184N) that confers resistance to guanidine-curing of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion. In an independent screen we isolated an HSP104 allele altered in the same residue (D184Y) that dramatically impairs [PSI(+)] propagation in a temperature-dependent manner. Directed mutagenesis of HSP104 produced additional alleles that conferred varying degrees of resistance to guanidine-curing or impaired [PSI(+)] propagation. The mutations similarly affected propagation of the [URE3] prion. Basal and induced abundance of all mutant proteins was normal. Thermotolerance of cells expressing mutant proteins was variably resistant to guanidine, and the degree of thermotolerance did not correlate with [PSI(+)] stability. We thus show that guanidine cures yeast prions by inactivating Hsp104 and identify a highly conserved Hsp104 residue that is critical for yeast prion propagation. Our data suggest that Hsp104 activity can be reduced substantially without affecting [PSI(+)] stability, and that Hsp104 interacts differently with prion aggregates than with aggregates of thermally denatured protein.},

abstract = {Prions are "infectious" proteins. When Sup35, a yeast translation termination factor, is aggregated in its [PSI(+)] prion form its function is compromised. When Rnq1 is aggregated in its [PIN(+)] prion form, it promotes the de novo appearance of [PSI(+)]. Heritable variants (strains) of [PSI(+)] with distinct phenotypes have been isolated and are analogous to mammalian prion strains with different pathologies. Here, we describe heritable variants of the [PIN(+)] prion that are distinguished by the efficiency with which they enhance the de novo appearance of [PSI(+)]. Unlike [PSI(+)] variants, where the strength of translation termination corresponds to the level of soluble Sup35, the phenotypes of these [PIN(+)] variants do not correspond to levels of soluble Rnq1. However, diploids and meiotic progeny from crosses between either different [PSI(+)], or different [PIN(+)] variants, always have the phenotype of the parental variant with the least soluble Sup35 or Rnq1, respectively. Apparently faster growing prion variants cure cells of slower growing or less stable variants of the same prion. We also find that YDJ1 overexpression eliminates some but not other [PIN(+)] variants and that prions are destabilized by meiosis. Finally, we show that, like its affect on [PSI(+)] appearance, [PIN(+)] enhances the de novo appearance of [URE3]. Surprisingly, [PSI(+)] inhibited [URE3] appearance. These results reinforce earlier reports that heterologous prions interact, but suggest that such interactions can not only positively, but also negatively, influence the de novo generation of prions.},

abstract = {A remarkable feature of prions is that infectious particles composed of the same prion protein can give rise to different phenotypes. This strain phenomenon suggests that a single prion protein can adopt multiple infectious conformations. Here we use a novel single fiber growth assay to examine the heterogeneity of amyloid fibers formed by the yeast Sup35 prion protein. Sup35 spontaneously forms multiple, distinct and faithfully propagating fiber types, which differ dramatically both in their degrees of polarity and overall growth rates. Both in terms of the number of distinct self-propagating fiber types, as well as the ability of these differences to dictate the rate of prion growth, this diversity is well suited to account for the range of prion strain phenotypes observed in vivo.},

abstract = {Overproduced fusions of Sup35 or its prion domain with green fluorescent protein (GFP) have previously been shown to form frequent dots in [PSI(+)] cells. Rare foci seen in [psi(-)] cells were hypothesized to indicate the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] caused by the overproduced prion domain. Here, we describe novel ring-type aggregates that also appear in [psi(-)] cultures upon Sup35 overproduction and show directly that dot and ring aggregates only appear in cells that have become [PSI(+)]. The formation of either type of aggregate requires [PIN(+)], an element needed for the induction of [PSI(+)]. Although aggregates are visible predominantly in stationary-phase cultures, [PSI(+)] induction starts in exponential phase, suggesting that much smaller aggregates can also propagate [PSI(+)]. Such small aggregates are probably present in [PSI(+)] cells and, upon Sup35-GFP overproduction, facilitate the frequent formation of dot aggregates, but only the occasional appearance of ring aggregates. In contrast, rings are very frequent when [PSI(+)] cultures, including those lacking [PIN(+)], are grown in the presence of GuHCl or excess Hsp104 while overexpressing Sup35-GFP. Thus, intermediates formed during [PSI(+)] curing seem to facilitate ring formation. Surprisingly, GuHCl and excess Hsp104, which are known to promote loss of [PSI(+)], did not prevent the de novo induction of [PSI(+)] by excess Sup35 in [psi(-)][PIN(+)] strains.},

For the prion [PSI(+)] this protein is Sup35, which is comprised of a prion-determining region (NM) fused to a translational termination region. [PSI(+)] strains (variants) with different heritable translational termination defects (weak or strong) can exist in the same genetic background. [PSI(+)] variants are reminiscent of mammalian prion strains, which can be passaged in the same mouse strain yet have different disease latencies and brain pathologies. We found that [PSI(+)] variants contain different ratios of Sup35 in the prion and non-prion state that correlate with different translation termination efficiencies. Indeed, the partially purified prion form of Sup35 from a strong [PSI(+)] variant converted purified NM much more efficiently than that of several weak variants. However, this difference was lost in a second round of conversion in vitro. Thus, [PSI(+)] variants result from differences in the efficiency of prion-mediated conversion, and the maintenance of [PSI(+)] variants involves more than nucleated conformational conversion (templating) to NM alone.},

Soluble protein then assembles with these nuclei to form amyloid fibers. Whether fiber growth is bidirectional or unidirectional has been determined for two amyloids. In these cases, bidirectional growth was established by time lapse atomic-force microscopy. Here, we investigated the growth of amyloid fibers formed by NM, the prion-determining region of the yeast protein Sup35p. The conformational changes in NM that lead to amyloid formation in vitro serve as a model for the self-perpetuating conformational changes in Sup35p that allow this protein to serve as an epigenetic element of inheritance in vivo. To assess the directionality of fiber growth, we genetically engineered a mutant of NM so that it contained an accessible cysteine residue that was easily labeled after fiber formation. The mutant protein assembled in vitro with kinetics indistinguishable from those of the wild-type protein and propagated the heritable genetic trait [PSI(+)] with the same fidelity. In reactions nucleated with prelabeled fibers, unlabeled protein assembled at both ends. Thus, NM fiber growth is bidirectional.},

abstract = {The cause of Huntington's disease is expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in huntingtin, which makes this protein both neurotoxic and aggregation prone. Here we developed the first yeast model, which establishes a direct link between aggregation of expanded polyQ domain and its cytotoxicity. Our data indicated that deficiencies in molecular chaperones Sis1 and Hsp104 inhibited seeding of polyQ aggregates, whereas ssa1, ssa2, and ydj1-151 mutations inhibited expansion of aggregates. The latter three mutants strongly suppressed the polyQ toxicity. Spontaneous mutants with suppressed aggregation appeared with high frequency, and in all of them the toxicity was relieved. Aggregation defects in these mutants and in sis1-85 were not complemented in the cross to the hsp104 mutant, demonstrating an unusual type of inheritance. Since Hsp104 is required for prion maintenance in yeast, this suggested a role for prions in polyQ aggregation and toxicity. We screened a set of deletions of nonessential genes coding for known prions and related proteins and found that deletion of the RNQ1 gene specifically suppressed aggregation and toxicity of polyQ. Curing of the prion form of Rnq1 from wild-type cells dramatically suppressed both aggregation and toxicity of polyQ. We concluded that aggregation of polyQ is critical for its toxicity and that Rnq1 in its prion conformation plays an essential role in polyQ aggregation leading to the toxicity.},

abstract = {The [PSI] genetic element, which enhances the nonsense suppression efficiency in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is thought to be amyloid-like aggregates of the Sup35 protein, and to self-propagate by a prion-like mechanism. Analogous to strains of the mammalian prion, variants of [PSI], with different nonsense suppression efficiencies and mitotic stabilities, can be isolated from the same yeast genetic background. In the framework of the "protein-only" hypothesis, variants of prion are assumed to be distinct conformers of the same prion polypeptide. This study aims to provide further support for the structural basis of [PSI] variation. Three variants of [PSI] were induced and distinguished by a panel of 11 single point mutations of the Sup35 protein. The variant phenotypes are intrinsically associated with [PSI] elements, presumably structurally different amyloids, rather than produced from variations in the genetic background. Differential incorporation to [PSI] variants of a Sup35 point mutation as well as N and C-terminally truncated Sup35 fragments is further demonstrated in vivo, suggesting that distinct patches of amino acid residues are involved in the assembly of [PSI] variants. These results establish a method for [PSI] variant-typing and indicate that heritable variations of amyloid structures can be derived from the same polypeptide.},

abstract = {The prion-like behavior of Sup35p, the eRF3 homolog in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mediates the activity of the cytoplasmic nonsense suppressor known as [PSI(+)]. Sup35p is divided into three regions of distinct function. The N-terminal and middle (M) regions are required for the induction and propagation of [PSI(+)] but are not necessary for translation termination or cell viability. The C-terminal region encompasses the termination function. The existence of the N-terminal region in SUP35 homologs of other fungi has led some to suggest that this region has an adaptive function separate from translation termination. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced portions of SUP35 in 21 strains of S. cerevisiae, including 13 clinical isolates. We analyzed nucleotide polymorphism within this species and compared it to sequence divergence from a sister species, S. paradoxus. The N domain of Sup35p is highly conserved in amino acid sequence and is highly biased in codon usage toward preferred codons. Amino acid changes are under weak purifying selection based on a quantitative analysis of polymorphism and divergence. We also conclude that the clinical strains of S. cerevisiae are not recently derived and that outcrossing between strains in S. cerevisiae may be relatively rare in nature.},

When green-Sup35NM was added to the preformed fibers made of red-Sup35NM, 70-97{\%} of green fibers grew unidirectionally, from only one end of individual red fibers, whereas the remainder grew from both ends. Similarly, the majority of red fibers grew from only one end of green fibers when the order of addition was reversed. Sonication of preformed fibers to expose fresh ends did not change the results, excluding a possibility of occasional deformation of one end as the reason of the apparent unidirectional growth.

abstract = {X-ray diffraction and other biophysical tools reveal features of the atomic structure of an amyloid-like crystal. Sup35, a prion-like protein in yeast, forms fibrillar amyloid assemblies intrinsic to its prion function. We have identified a polar peptide from the N-terminal prion-determining domain of Sup35 that exhibits the amyloid properties of full-length Sup35, including cooperative kinetics of aggregation, fibril formation, binding of the dye Congo red, and the characteristic cross-beta x-ray diffraction pattern. Microcrystals of this peptide also share the principal properties of the fibrillar amyloid, including a highly stable, beta-sheet-rich structure and the binding of Congo red. The x-ray powder pattern of the microcrystals, extending to 0.9-A resolution, yields the unit cell dimensions of the well-ordered structure. These dimensions restrict possible atomic models of this amyloid-like structure and demonstrate that it forms packed, parallel-stranded beta-sheets. The unusually high density of the crystals shows that the packed beta-sheets are dehydrated, despite the polar character of the side chains. These results suggest that amyloid is a highly intermolecularly bonded, dehydrated array of densely packed beta-sheets. This dry beta-sheet could form as Sup35 partially unfolds to expose the peptide, permitting it to hydrogen-bond to the same peptide of other Sup35 molecules. The implication is that amyloid-forming units may be short segments of proteins, exposed for interactions by partial unfolding.},

As with mammalian prions, a species barrier inhibits prion induction between Sup35p from different yeast species. This barrier is faithfully reproduced in vitro where, remarkably, ongoing polymerization of one Sup35p species does not affect conversion of another. Chimeric analysis identifies a short domain sufficient to allow foreign Sup35p to cross this barrier. These observations argue that the species barrier results from specificity in the growing aggregate, mediated by a well-defined epitope on the amyloid surface and, together with our identification of a novel yeast prion domain, show that multiple prion-based heritable states can propagate independently within one cell.},

abstract = {Glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich domains have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils. This phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. To examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for Q/N-rich regions. We found that Q/N-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. Moreover, the average Q/N content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. Mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with Q/N-rich regions. Remarkably, Q/N-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. Analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular "polar zipper" protein-protein interaction domains. These data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion [PSI ] is a self-propagating isoform of the eukaryotic release factor eRF3 (Sup35p). Sup35p consists of the evolutionary conserved release factor domain (Sup35C) and two evolutionary variable regions - Sup35N, which serves as a prion-forming domain in S. cerevisiae, and Sup35M. Here, we demonstrate that the prion form of Sup35p is not observed among industrial and natural strains of yeast. Moreover, the prion ([PSI + ]) state of the endogenous S. cerevisiae Sup35p cannot be transmitted to the next generations via heterologous Sup35p or Sup35NM, originating from the distantly related yeast species Pichia methanolica. This suggests the existence of a 'species barrier' in yeast prion conversion. However, the chimeric Sup35p, containing the Sup35NM region of Pichia, can be turned into a prion in S. cerevisiae by overproduction of the identical Pichia Sup35NM. Therefore, the prion-forming potential of Sup35NM is conserved in evolution. In the heterologous system, overproduction of Pichia Sup35p or Sup35NM induced formation of the prion form of S. cerevisiae Sup35p, albeit less efficiently than overproduction of the endogenous Sup35p. This implies that prion induction by protein overproduction does not require strict correspondence of the 'inducer' and 'inducee' sequences, and can overcome the 'species barrier'.},

abstract = {The cytoplasmic heritable determinant [PSI(+)] of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reflects the prion-like properties of the chromosome-encoded protein Sup35p. This protein is known to be an essential eukaryote polypeptide release factor, namely eRF3. In a [PSI(+)] background, the prion conformer of Sup35p forms large oligomers, which results in the intracellular depletion of functional release factor and hence inefficient translation termination. We have investigated the process by which the [PSI(+)] determinant can be efficiently eliminated from strains, by growth in the presence of the protein denaturant guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). Strains are "cured" of [PSI(+)] by millimolar concentrations of GuHCl, well below that normally required for protein denaturation. Here we provide evidence indicating that the elimination of the [PSI(+)] determinant is not derived from the direct dissolution of self-replicating [PSI(+)] seeds by GuHCl. Although GuHCl does elicit a moderate stress response, the elimination of [PSI(+)] is not enhanced by stress, and furthermore, exhibits an absolute requirement for continued cell division. We propose that GuHCl inhibits a critical event in the propagation of the prion conformer and demonstrate that the kinetics of curing by GuHCl fit a random segregation model whereby the heritable [PSI(+)] element is diluted from a culture, after the total inhibition of prion replication by GuHCl.},

abstract = {We have previously described different variants of the yeast prion [PSI+] that can be obtained and maintained in the same genetic background. These [PSI+] variants, which differ in the efficiency of nonsense suppression, mitotic stability and the efficiency of curing by GuHCl, may correspond to different [PSI+] prion conformations of Sup35p or to different types of prion aggregates. Here we investigate the effects of overexpressing a mutant allele of SUP35 and find different effects on weak and strong [PSI+] variants: the suppressor phenotype of weak [PSI+] factors is increased, whereas the suppressor effect of strong [PSI+] factors is reduced. The SUP35 mutation used was originally described as a "Psi no more" mutation (PNM2) because it caused loss of [PSI+]. However, none of the [PSI+] variants in the strains used in our study were cured by PNM2. Indeed, when overexpressed, PNM2 induced the de novo appearance of both weak and strong [PSI+] variants with approximately the same efficiency as the overexpressed wild-type SUP35 allele. Our data suggest that the change in the region of oligopeptide repeats in the Sup35p N-terminus due to the PNM2 mutation modifies, but does not impair, the function of the prion domain of Sup35p.},

abstract = {Propagation of the yeast protein-based non-Mendelian element [PSI], a prion-like form of the release factor Sup35, was shown to be regulated by the interplay between chaperone proteins Hsp104 and Hsp70. While overproduction of Hsp104 protein cures cells of [PSI], overproduction of the Ssa1 protein of the Hsp70 family protects [PSI] from the curing effect of Hsp104. Here we demonstrate that another protein of the Hsp70 family, Ssb, previously implicated in nascent polypeptide folding and protein turnover, exhibits effects on [PSI] which are opposite those of Ssa. Ssb overproduction increases, while Ssb depletion decreases, [PSI] curing by the overproduced Hsp104. Both spontaneous [PSI] formation and [PSI] induction by overproduction of the homologous or heterologous Sup35 protein are increased significantly in the strain lacking Ssb. This is the first example when inactivation of an unrelated cellular protein facilitates prion formation. Ssb is therefore playing a role in protein-based inheritance, which is analogous to the role played by the products of mutator genes in nucleic acid-based inheritance. Ssb depletion also decreases toxicity of the overproduced Sup35 and causes extreme sensitivity to the [PSI]-curing chemical agent guanidine hydrochloride. Our data demonstrate that various members of the yeast Hsp70 family have diverged from each other in regard to their roles in prion propagation and suggest that Ssb could serve as a proofreading component of the enzymatic system, which prevents formation of prion aggregates.},

abstract = {[PSI+], a non-Mendelian element found in some strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is presumed to be the manifestation of a self-propagating prion conformation of eRF3 (Sup35p). Translation termination factor eRF3 enhances the activity of release factor eRF1 (Sup45p). As predicted by the prion model, overproduction of Sup35p induces the de novo appearance of [PSI+]. However, another non-Mendelian determinant, [PIN+], is required for this induction. We now show that SUP45 overexpression inhibits the induction of [PSI+] by Sup35p overproduction in [PIN+] strains, but has no effect on the propagation of [PSI+] or on the [PIN] status of the cells. We also show that SUP45 overexpression counteracts the growth inhibition usually associated with overexpression of SUP35 in [PSI+] strains. We argue that excess Sup45p inhibits [PSI+] seed formation. Because Sup45p complexes with Sup35p, we hypothesize that excess Sup45p may sequester Sup35p, thereby reducing the opportunity for Sup35p conformational flips and/or self-interactions leading to prion formation. This in vivo yeast result is reminiscent of the in vitro finding by investigators of Alzheimer disease that apolipoprotein E inhibits amyloid nucleation, but does not reduce seeded growth of amyloid.},

abstract = {Prion strains (or variants) are structurally distinct amyloid conformations arising from a single polypeptide sequence. The existence of prion strains has been well documented in mammalian prion diseases. In many cases, prion strains manifest as variation in disease progression and pathology, and in some cases, these prion strains also show distinct biochemical properties. Yet, the underlying basis of prion propagation and the extent of conformational possibilities available to amyloidogenic proteins remain largely undefined. Prion proteins in yeast that are also capable of maintaining multiple self-propagating structures have provided much insight into prion biology. Here, we explore the vast structural diversity of the yeast prion [RNQ+] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screened for the formation of [RNQ+] in vivo, allowing us to calculate the rate of spontaneous formation as {\~{}}2.96x10(-6), and successfully isolate several different [RNQ+] variants. Through a comprehensive set of biochemical and biological analyses, we show that these prion variants are indeed novel. No individual property or set of properties, including aggregate stability and size, was sufficient to explain the physical basis and range of prion variants and their resulting cellular phenotypes. Furthermore, all of the [RNQ+] variants that we isolated were able to facilitate the de novo formation of the yeast prion [PSI+], an epigenetic determinant of translation termination. This supports the hypothesis that [RNQ+] acts as a functional amyloid in regulating the formation of [PSI+] to produce phenotypic diversity within a yeast population and promote adaptation.

abstract = {The tRNA gene-mediated (tgm) silencing of RNA polymerase II promoters is dependent on subnuclear clustering of the tRNA genes, but genetic analysis shows that the silencing requires additional mechanisms. We have identified proteins that bind tRNA gene transcription complexes and are required for tgm silencing but not required for gene clustering. One of the proteins, Mod5, is a tRNA modifying enzyme that adds an N6-isopentenyl adenosine modification at position 37 on a small number of tRNAs in the cytoplasm, although a subpopulation of Mod5 is also found in the nucleus. Recent publications have also shown that Mod5 has tumor suppressor characteristics in humans as well as confers drug resistance through prion-like misfolding in yeast. Here, we show that a subpopulation of Mod5 associates with tRNA gene complexes in the nucleolus. This association occurs and is required for tgm silencing regardless of whether the pre-tRNA transcripts are substrates for Mod5 modification. In addition, Mod5 is bound to nuclear pre-tRNA transcripts, although they are not substrates for the A37 modification. Lastly, we show that truncation of the tRNA transcript to remove the normal tRNA structure also alleviates silencing, suggesting that synthesis of intact pre-tRNAs is required for the silencing mechanism. These results are discussed in light of recent results showing that silencing near tRNA genes also requires chromatin modification.},

abstract = {Prion conversion from a soluble protein to an aggregated state may be involved in the cellular adaptation of yeast to the environment. However, it remains unclear whether and how cells actively use prion conversion to acquire a fitness advantage in response to environmental stress. We identified Mod5, a yeast transfer RNA isopentenyltransferase lacking glutamine/asparagine-rich domains, as a yeast prion protein and found that its prion conversion in yeast regulated the sterol biosynthetic pathway for acquired cellular resistance against antifungal agents. Furthermore, selective pressure by antifungal drugs on yeast facilitated the de novo appearance of Mod5 prion states for cell survival. Thus, phenotypic changes caused by active prion conversion under environmental selection may contribute to cellular adaptation in living organisms.},

abstract = {The causal agents of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases, sometimes called prion diseases, are characterized by high resistance to inactivation with heat. Results from thermal inactivation experiments on nine TSE strains, seven passaged in two PrP genotypes, showed differences in sensitivity to heat inactivation ranging over 17 °C. In addition, the rate of inactivation with increasing temperature varied between TSE models. In some cases passage in an alternative PrP genotype had little effect on the resulting inactivation properties, but for others the infectious agent was inactivated at lower temperatures. No strain with higher thermostability properties was selected. The effect of mixing two TSE strains, to see whether their properties were affected through interaction with each other, was also examined. The results showed that both strains behaved as expected from the behaviour of the unmixed controls, and that the strain responsible for inducing TSE disease could be identified. There was no evidence of a direct effect on intrinsic strain properties. Overall, the results illustrate the diversity in properties of TSE strains. They require intrinsic molecular properties of TSE agents to accommodate high resistance to inactivation and a mechanism, independent of the host, to directly encode these differences. These findings are more readily reconciled with models of TSE agents with two separate components, one of which is independent of the host and comprises a TSE-specific nucleic acid, than with models based solely on conformational changes to a host protein.},

abstract = {Human prion diseases are associated with a range of clinical presentations and are classified by both clinicopathological syndrome and aetiology with sub-classification according to molecular criteria. Considerable experimental evidence suggests that phenotypic diversity in human prion disease relates in significant part to the existence of distinct human prion strains encoded by abnormal PrP isoforms with differing physicochemical properties. To date, however, the conformational repertoire of pathological isoforms of wild-type human PrP and the various forms of mutant human PrP has not been fully defined. Efforts to produce a unified international classification of human prion disease are still ongoing. The ability of genetic background to influence prion strain selection together with knowledge of numerous other factors that may influence clinical and neuropathological presentation strongly emphasises the requirement to identify distinct human prion strains in appropriate transgenic models, where host genetic variability and other modifiers of phenotype are removed. Defining how many human prion strains exist allied with transgenic modelling of potentially zoonotic prion strains will inform on how many human infections may have an animal origin. Understanding these relationships will have direct translation to protecting public health.},

Currently, studying prion replication in vitro is difficult due to the lack of a system which fully recapitulates the in vivo phenomenon. Over the last 15 years, a number of in vitro systems supporting PrP(C) conversion, PrP(Sc) amplification, or amyloid fibril formation have been established.

Conformational change of the normal (cellular) form of prion protein (PrP c) to a pathological, disease-associated form (PrP TSE) is considered central to pathogenesis and formation of the infectious agent or prion. Neuronal damage is central to clinical manifestation of prion diseases but poorly understood. In this review, we analyze the major pathogenetic pathways that lead to tissue pathology in different forms of disease. Neuropathogenesis of prion diseases evolves in complex ways on several front lines, most but not all of which exist also in other neurodegenerative as well as infectious diseases. Whereas intracellular accumulation of PrP forms might significantly impair cell function and lead to cytopathology, mere extracellular deposition of PrP TSE is questionable as a direct cytotoxic factor. Tissue damage may result from several parallel, interacting, or subsequent pathways. Future studies should clarify the trigger(s) and sequence of these processes and whether, and which, one is dominating or decisive.},

abstract = {Prions were originally defined as infectious agents of protein nature, which caused neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans. The prion concept implies that the infectious agent is a protein in special conformation that can be transmitted to the normal molecules of the same protein through protein-protein interactions. Until the 1990s, the prion phenomenon was associated with the single protein named PrP. Discovery of prions in lower eukaryotes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fungus Podospora anserina, suggests that prions have wider significance. Prions of lower eukaryotes are not related to diseases; their propagation caused by aggregation of prion-like proteins underlies the inheritance of phenotypic traits and most likely has adaptive significance. This review covers prions of mammals and lower eukaryotes, mechanisms of their appearance de novo and maintenance, structure of prion particles, and prospects for the treatment of prion diseases. Recent data concerning the search for new prion-like proteins is included. The paper focuses on the [PSI+] prion of S. cerevisiae, since at present it is the most investigated one.

The changing epidemiological patterns and other significant findings such as the transmissibility of kuru are described in their historical progression. Monitoring the progress of the epidemic has been carried out by epidemiological surveillance in the field for 50 years. From its peak, the number of deaths from kuru declined to 2 in the last 5 years, indicating that the epidemic is approaching its end. The mode of transmission of the prion agent of kuru was the local mortuary practice of transumption. The prohibition of this practice in the 1950s led to the decline in the epidemic, which has been prolonged into the present century by incubation periods that may exceed 50 years. Currently, the epidemiological surveillance is being maintained and further studies on human genetics and the past mortuary practices are being conducted in the kuru-affected region and in communities beyond it.},

At least four novel prion diseases--including human diseases variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI), bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE), and Nor98 of sheep--have been identified in the last ten years, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) of North American deer (Odocoileus Specis) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) is undergoing a dramatic spread across North America. While amplification (BSE) and dissemination (CWD, commercial sourcing of cervids from the wild and movement of farmed elk) can be attributed to human activity, the origins of emergent prion diseases cannot always be laid at the door of humankind. Instead, the continued appearance of new outbreaks in the form of "sporadic" disease may be an inevitable outcome in a situation where the replicating pathogen is host-encoded.},

abstract = {Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals that are important because of their impact on public health and because they exemplify a novel mechanism of infectivity and biological information transfer. These diseases are caused by conformational conversion of a normal host glycoprotein (PrPC) into an infectious isoform (PrPSc) that is devoid of nucleic acid. This review focuses on the current understanding of prion diseases at the cell biological level. The characteristics of the diseases are introduced, and a brief history and description of the prion hypothesis are given. Information is then presented about the structure, expression, biosynthesis, and possible function of PrPC, as well as its posttranslational processing, cellular localization, and trafficking. The latest findings concerning PrPSc are then discussed, including cell culture systems used to generate this pathogenic isoform, the subcellular distribution of the protein, its membrane attachment, proteolytic processing, and its kinetics and sites of synthesis. Information is also provided on molecular models of the PrPC-->PrPSc conversion reaction and the possible role of cellular chaperones. The review concludes with suggestions of several important avenues for future investigation.},

abstract = {Prions are self-templating protein conformers that replicate by recruitment and conversion of homotypic proteins into growing protein aggregates. Originally identified as causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, increasing evidence now suggests that prion-like phenomena are more common in nature than previously anticipated. In contrast to fungal prions that replicate in the cytoplasm, propagation of mammalian prions derived from the precursor protein PrP is confined to the cell membrane or endocytic vesicles. Here we demonstrate that cytosolic protein aggregates can also behave as infectious entities in mammalian cells. When expressed in the mammalian cytosol, protein aggregates derived from the prion domain NM of yeast translation termination factor Sup35 persistently propagate and invade neighboring cells, thereby inducing a self-perpetuating aggregation state of NM. Cell contact is required for efficient infection. Aggregates can also be induced in primary astrocytes, neurons, and organotypic cultures, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not specific to immortalized cells. Our data have important implications for understanding prion-like phenomena of protein aggregates associated with human diseases and for the growing number of amyloidogenic proteins discovered in mammals.},

abstract = {HET-s is a prion protein of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. An orthologue of this protein, called FgHET-s has been identified in Fusarium graminearum. The region of the FgHET-s protein corresponding to the prion forming domain of HET-s, forms amyloid fibrils in vitro. These fibrils seed HET-s(218-289) fibril formation in vitro and vice versa. The amyloid fold of HET-s(218-289) and FgHET-s(218-289) are remarkably similar although they share only 38{\%} identity. The present work corresponds to the functional characterization of the FgHET-s(218-289) region as a prion forming domain in vivo. We show that FgHET-s(218-289) is capable of prion propagation in P. anserina and is able to substitute for the HET-s PFD in the full-length HET-s protein. In accordance with the in vitro cross-seeding experiments, we detect no species barrier between P. anserina and F. graminearum PFDs. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host to compare the prion performances of the two orthologous PFDs. We find that FgHET-s(218-289) leads to higher spontaneous prion formation rates and mitotic prion stability than HET-s(218-289). Then we analysed the outcome of HET-s(218-289)/FgHET-s(218-289) coexpression. In spite of the cross-seeding ability of HET-s(218-289) and FgHET-s(218-289), in vivo, homotypic polymerization is favoured over mixed fibril formation.},

abstract = {HET-S (97{\%} identical to HET-s) has an N-terminal globular domain that exerts a prion-inhibitory effect in cis on its own prion-forming domain (PFD) and in trans on HET-s prion propagation. We show that HET-S fails to form fibrils in vitro and that it inhibits HET-s PFD fibrillization in trans. In vivo analyses indicate that beta-structuring of the HET-S PFD is required for HET-S activity. The crystal structures of the globular domains of HET-s and HET-S are highly similar, comprising a helical fold, while NMR-based characterizations revealed no differences in the conformations of the PFDs. We conclude that prion inhibition is not encoded by structure but rather in stability and oligomerization properties: when HET-S forms a prion seed or is incorporated into a HET-s fibril via its PFD, the beta-structuring in this domain induces a change in its globular domain, generating a molecular species that is incompetent for fibril growth.},

On the basis of 134 intra- and intermolecular experimental distance restraints, we find that HET-s(218-289) forms a left-handed beta solenoid, with each molecule forming two helical windings, a compact hydrophobic core, at least 23 hydrogen bonds, three salt bridges, and two asparagine ladders.

Recent studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of related fibrillar structures in bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs). Bacteria might thus provide a biologically relevant and tuneable system to study amyloid aggregation and how to interfere with it. Particularly suited for such studies are protein models for which structural information is available in both IBs and amyloid states. The only high-resolution structure of an infectious amyloid state reported to date is that of the HET-s prion forming domain (PFD). Importantly, recent solid-state NMR data indicates that the structure of HET-s PFD in IBs closely resembles that of the infectious fibrils. Here we present an exhaustive conformational characterization of HET-s IBs in order to establish the aggregation of this prion in bacteria as a consistent cellular model in which the effect of autologous or heterologous protein quality machineries and/or anti-aggregational and anti-prionic drugs can be further studied.},

abstract = {Prions are self-propagating, infectious aggregates of misfolded proteins. The mammalian prion, PrP(Sc), causes fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Fungi also have prions. While yeast prions depend upon glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich regions, the Podospora anserina HET-s and PrP prion proteins lack such sequences. Nonetheless, we show that the HET-s prion domain fused to GFP propagates as a prion in yeast. Analogously to native yeast prions, transient overexpression of the HET-s fusion induces ring-like aggregates that propagate in daughter cells as cytoplasmically inherited, detergent-resistant dot aggregates. Efficient dot propagation, but not ring formation, is dependent upon the Hsp104 chaperone. The yeast prion [PIN(+)] enhances HET-s ring formation, suggesting that prions with and without Q/N-rich regions interact. Finally, HET-s aggregates propagated in yeast are infectious when introduced into Podospora. Taken together, these results demonstrate prion propagation in a truly foreign host. Since yeast can host non-Q/N-rich prions, such native yeast prions may exist.},

abstract = {Fungal prions are infectious filamentous polymers of proteins that are soluble in uninfected cells. In its prion form, the HET-s protein of Podospora anserina participates in a fungal self/non-self recognition phenomenon called heterokaryon incompatibility. Like other prion proteins, HET-s has a so-called "prion domain" (its C-terminal region, HET-s-(218-289)) that is responsible for induction and propagation of the prion in vivo and for fibril formation in vitro. Prion fibrils are thought to have amyloid backbones of polymerized prion domains. A relatively detailed model has been proposed for prion domain fibrils of HET-s based on a variety of experimental constraints (Ritter, C., Maddelein, M. L., Siemer, A. B., Luhrs, T., Ernst, M., Meier, B. H., Saupe, S. J., and Riek, R. (2005) Nature 435, 844-848). To test specific predictions of this model, which envisages axial stacking of beta-solenoids with two coils per subunit, we examined fibrils by electron microscopy. Electron diffraction gave a prominent meridional reflection at (0.47 nm)(-1), indicative of cross-beta structure, as predicted. STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) mass-per-unit-length measurements yielded 1.02 +/- 0.16 subunits per 0.94 nm, in agreement with the model prediction (1 subunit per 0.94 nm). This is half the packing density of approximately 1 subunit per 0.47 nm previously obtained for fibrils of the yeast prion proteins, Ure2p and Sup35p, whence it follows that the respective amyloid architectures are basically different.},

In addition in yeast, Hsp104 was found to be required for prion propagation. Herein, we analyze the role of Podospora anserina Hsp104 (PaHsp104) in the formation and propagation of the [Het-s] prion. We show that DeltaPaHsp104 strains propagate [Het-s], making [Het-s] the first native fungal prion to be propagated in the absence of Hsp104. Nevertheless, we found that [Het-s]-propagon numbers, propagation rate, and spontaneous emergence are reduced in a DeltaPaHsp104 background. In addition, inactivation of PaHsp104 leads to severe meiotic instability of [Het-s] and abolishes its meiotic drive activity. Finally, we show that DeltaPaHSP104 strains are less susceptible than wild type to infection by exogenous recombinant HET-s(218-289) prion amyloids. Like [URE3] and [PIN(+)] in yeast but unlike [PSI(+)], [Het-s] is not cured by constitutive PaHsp104 overexpression. The observed effects of PaHsp104 inactivation are consistent with the described role of Hsp104 in prion aggregate shearing in yeast. However, Hsp104-dependency appears less stringent in P. anserina than in yeast; presumably because in Podospora prion propagation occurs in a syncitium.},

@article{Maddelein2007,
abstract = {Amyloid protein aggregation is involved in serious neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and transmissible encephalopathies. The concept of an infectious protein (prion) being the scrapie agent was successfully validated for several yeast and fungi proteins. Ure2, Sup35 and Rnq1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and HET-s in Podospora anserina have been genetically and biochemically identified as prion proteins. Studies on these proteins have revealed critical information on the mechanisms of prions appearance and propagation. The prion phenotype correlates with the aggregation state of these particular proteins. In vitro, the recombinant prion proteins form amyloid fibers characterized by rich beta sheet content. In a previous work on the HET-s prion protein Podospora, we demonstrated the infectivity of HET-s recombinant amyloid aggregates. More recently, the structural analysis of the HET-s prion domain associated with in vivo mutagenesis allowed us to propose a model for the infectious fold of the HET-s prion domain. Further investigations to complete this model are discussed in this review, as are relevant questions about the [Het-s] system of Podospora anserina.},

@article{Dalstra2003,
abstract = {In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, two phenomena are associated with polymorphism at the het-s locus, vegetative incompatibility and ascospore abortion. Two het-s alleles occur naturally, het-s and het-S. The het-s encoded protein is a prion propagating as a self-perpetuating amyloid aggregate. When prion-infected [Het-s] hyphae fuse with [Het-S] hyphae, the resulting heterokaryotic cells necrotize. [Het-s] and [Het-S] strains are sexually compatible. When, however, a female [Het-s] crosses with [Het-S], a significant percentage of het-S spores abort, in a way similar to spore killing in Neurospora and Podospora. We report here that sexual transmission of the [Het-s] prion after nonisogamous mating in the reproductive cycle of Podospora is responsible for the killing of het-S spores. Progeny of crosses between isogenic strains with distinct wild-type or introduced, ectopic het-s/S alleles were cytologically and genetically analyzed. The effect of het-s/S overexpression, ectopic het-s/S expression, absence of het-s expression, loss of [Het-s] prion infection, and the distribution patterns of HET-s/S-GFP proteins were categorized during meiosis and ascospore formation. This study unveiled a het-S spore-killing system that is governed by dosage of and interaction between the [Het-s] prion and the HET-S protein. Due to this property of the [Het-s] prion, the het-s allele acts as a meiotic drive element favoring maintenance of the prion-forming allele in natural populations.},

abstract = {The [Het-s] infectious element of the fungus Podospora anserina is a prion protein involved in a genetically controlled cell death reaction termed heterokaryon incompatibility. Previous analyses indicate that [Het-s] propagates as a self-perpetuating amyloid aggregate. The HET-s protein is 289 amino acids in length. Herein, we identify the region of the HET-s protein that is responsible for amyloid formation and prion propagation. The region of HET-s spanning residues 218-289 forms amyloid fibers in vitro and allows prion propagation in vivo. Conversely, a C-terminal deletion in HET-s prevents amyloid aggregation in vitro and prion propagation in vivo, and abolishes the incompatibility function. In the soluble form of HET-s, the region from residue 1 to 227 forms a well-folded domain while the C-terminal region is highly flexible. Together, our data establish a domain structure-function relationship for HET-s amyloid formation, prion propagation and incompatibility activity.},

@article{Coustou1997,
abstract = {The het-s locus of Podospora anserina is a heterokaryon incompatibility locus. The coexpression of the antagonistic het-s and het-S alleles triggers a lethal reaction that prevents the formation of viable heterokaryons. Strains that contain the het-s allele can display two different phenotypes, [Het-s] or [Het-s*], according to their reactivity in incompatibility. The detection in these phenotypically distinct strains of a protein expressed from the het-s gene indicates that the difference in reactivity depends on a posttranslational difference between two forms of the polypeptide encoded by the het-s gene. This posttranslational modification does not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the protein in SDS/PAGE. Several results suggest a similarity of behavior between the protein encoded by the het-s gene and prions. The [Het-s] character can propagate in [Het-s*] strains as an infectious agent, producing a [Het-s*] --> [Het-s] transition, independently of protein synthesis. Expression of the [Het-s] character requires a functional het-s gene. The protein present in [Het-s] strains is more resistant to proteinase K than that present in [Het-s*] mycelium. Furthermore, overexpression of the het-s gene increases the frequency of the transition from [Het-s*] to [Het-s]. We propose that this transition is the consequence of a self-propagating conformational modification of the protein mediated by the formation of complexes between the two different forms of the polypeptide.},
