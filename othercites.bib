	abstract = {We examined the nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene from 25 primates (4 hominoids, 8 Old World monkeys, 2 New World monkeys, 2 tarsiers, 7 lemuriforms, 2 lorisiforms). Marginal support was found for three phylogenetic conclusions: (1) sister-group relationship between tarsiers and a monkey/ape clade, (2) placement of the aye-aye (Daubentonia) sister to all other strepsirhine primates, and (3) rejection of a sister-group relationship of dwarf lemurs (i.e., Cheirogaleus) with lorisiform primates. Stronger support was found for a sister-group relationship between the ring-tail lemur (Lemur catta) and the gentle lemurs (Hapalemur). In congruence with previous studies on COII, we found that the monkeys and apes have undergone a nearly two-fold increase in the rate of amino acid replacement relative to other primates. Although functionally important amino acids are generally conserved among all primates, the acceleration in amino acid replacements in higher primates is associated with increased variation in the amino terminal end of the protein. Additionally, the replacement of two carboxyl-bearing residues (glutamate and aspartate) at positions 114 and 115 may provide a partial explanation for the poor enzyme kinetics in cross-reactions between the cytochromes c and cytochrome c oxidases of higher primates and other mammals. {\textcopyright} 1994, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

	abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been used to study molecular ecology and phylogeography for 25 years. Much important information has been gained in this way, but it is time to reflect on the biology of the mitochondrion itself and consider opportunities for evolutionary studies of the organelle itself and its ecology, biochemistry and physiology. This review has four sections. First, we review aspects of the natural history of mitochondria and their DNA to show that it is a unique molecule with specific characteristics that differ from nuclear DNA. We do not attempt to cover the plethora of differences between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA; rather we spotlight differences that can cause significant bias when inferring demographic properties of populations and/or the evolutionary history of species. We focus on recombination, effective population size and mutation rate. Second, we explore some of the difficulties in interpreting phylogeographical data from mtDNA data alone and suggest a broader use of multiple nuclear markers. We argue that mtDNA is not a sufficient marker for phylogeographical studies if the focus of the investigation is the species and not the organelle. We focus on the potential bias caused by introgression. Third, we show that it is not safe to assume a priori that mtDNA evolves as a strictly neutral marker because both direct and indirect selection influence mitochondria. We outline some of the statistical tests of neutrality that can, and should, be applied to mtDNA sequence data prior to making any global statements concerning the history of the organism. We conclude with a critical examination of the neglected biology of mitochondria and point out several surprising gaps in the state of our knowledge about this important organelle. Here we lime-light mitochondrial ecology, sexually antagonistic selection, life-history evolution including ageing and disease, and the evolution of mitochondrial inheritance.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is an important tool for the investigation of the population genetics of animal species. Recently, recognition of the role of mtDNA mutations in human disease has spurred increasing interest in the function and evolution of mtDNA and the 13 polypeptides it encodes. These proteins interact with a large number of peptides encoded in the nucleus to form the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS). As the ETS is the primary energy generation system in aerobic metazoans, natural selection would be expected to favor mutations that enhance ETS function. Such mutations could occur in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genes encoding ETS proteins and would lead to positive intergenomic interactions, or co-adaptation. Direct evidence for intergenomic co-adaptation comes from functional studies of systems where nuclear-mitochondrial DNA combinations vary naturally or can be manipulated experimentally.},

The cytochrome bc1 complex participates in respiration in eukaryotic cells and also participates in respiration, cyclic photosynthetic electron transfer, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation in a phylogenetically diverse collection of bacteria. In all of these organisms, the cytochrome bc1 complex transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and links this electron transfer to translocation of protons across the membrane in which it resides, thus converting the available free energy of the oxidation-reduction reaction into an electrochemical proton gradient. The mechanism by which the cytochrome bc1 complex achieves this energy transduction is the protonmotive Q cycle. The Q cycle mechanism has been documented by extensive experimentation, and recent investigations have focused on structural features of the three redox subunits of the bc1 complex essential to the protonmotive and electrogenic activities of this membranous enzyme. {\textcopyright} 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Mitochondrial and nuclear genes, protein coding, rRNA, and nontranslated sequences from 61 mammal species representing 14 orders are used to compare the relative rates of sequence evolution. Correlation analyses performed on differences in genetic distance since common origin of each pair against differences in body mass, generation time, and metabolic rate reveal that substitution rate at fourfold degenerate sites in two out of three protein sequences is negatively correlated with generation time. In addition, there is a relationship between the rate of molecular evolution and body size for two nuclear-encoded sequences. No evidence is found for an effect of metabolic rate on rate of sequence evolution. Possible causes of variation in substitution rate between species are discussed.},

We studied the adaptive patterns of altitudinal stresses on transcriptome turnover in subterranean plateau zokors (Myospalax baileyi) in the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Transcriptomes of zokors from three populations with distinct altitudes and ecologies (Low: 2846 m, Middle: 3282 m, High: 3,714 m) were sequenced and compared. Phylogenetic and principal component analyses classified them into three divergent altitudinal population clusters. Genetic polymorphisms showed that the population at H, approaching the uppermost species boundary, harbors the highest genetic polymorphism. Moreover, 1056 highly up-regulated UniGenes were identified from M to H. Gene ontologies reveal genes like EPAS1 and COX1 were overexpressed under hypoxia conditions. EPAS1, EGLN1, and COX1 were convergent in high-altitude adaptation against stresses in other species. The fixation indices (F ST and G ST )-based outlier analysis identified 191 and 211 genes, highly differentiated among L, M, and H. We observed adaptive transcriptome changes in Myospalax baileyi, across a few hundred meters, near the uppermost species boundary, regardless of their relatively stable underground burrows' microclimate. The highly variant genes identified in Myospalax were involved in hypoxia tolerance, hypercapnia tolerance, ATP-pathway energetics, and temperature changes.},

To explore this relationship in a natural population of vertebrates, we characterized Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) variation in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (the talas tuco-tuco) as a function of parasite load and ability to mount an adaptive immune response against a novel antigen. Specifically, we quantified genotypic diversity at the MHC class II DRB locus in relation to (1) natural variation in infection by multiple genera of parasites (potential agents of selection on MHC genes) and (2) antibody production in response to injection with sheep red blood cells (a measure of immunocompetence). Data were analyzed using co-inertia multivariate statistics, with epidemiological proxies for individual condition (hematocrit, leukocyte profile, body weight) and risk of parasite exposure (season of capture, sex). A significant excess of DRB heterozygotes was evident in the study population. Co-inertia analyses revealed significant associations between specific DRB alleles and both parasite load and intensity of humoral immune response against sheep red blood cells. The presence of specific DRB aminoacid sequences appeared to be more strongly associated with parasite load and response to a novel antigen than was heterozygosity at the DRB locus. These data suggest a role for parasite-driven balancing selection in maintaining MHC variation in natural populations of C. talarum. At the same time, these findings underscore the importance of using diverse parameters to study interactions among physiological conditions, immunocompetence, and MHC diversity in free-living animals that are confronted with multiple simultaneous immune challenges. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The mitochondria produce up to 95 of a eukaryotic cell's energy through oxidative phosphorylation. The proteins involved in this vital process are under high functional constraints. However, metabolic requirements vary across species, potentially modifying selective pressures. We evaluate the adaptive evolution of 12 protein-coding mitochondrial genes in 41 placental mammalian species by assessing amino acid sequence variation and exploring the functional implications of observed variation in secondary and tertiary protein structures. Results: Wide variation in the properties of amino acids were observed at functionally important regions of cytochrome b in species with more-specialized metabolic requirements (such as adaptation to low energy diet or large body size, such as in elephant, dugong, sloth, and pangolin, and adaptation to unusual oxygen requirements, for example diving in cetaceans, flying in bats, and living at high altitudes in alpacas). Signatures of adaptive variation in the NADH dehydrogenase complex were restricted to the loop regions of the transmembrane units which likely function as protons pumps. Evidence of adaptive variation in the cytochrome c oxidase complex was observed mostly at the interface between the mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits, perhaps evidence of co-evolution. The ATP8 subunit, which has an important role in the assembly of F0, exhibited the highest signal of adaptive variation. ATP6, which has an essential role in rotor performance, showed a high adaptive variation in predicted loop areas. Conclusion: Our study provides insight into the adaptive evolution of the mtDNA genome in mammals and its implications for the molecular mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation. We present a framework for future experimental characterization of the impact of specific mutations in the function, physiology, and interactions of the mtDNA encoded proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. {\textcopyright} 2008 da Fonseca et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The 13 peptides encoded by vertebrate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are essential subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes. These genes normally experience purifying selection and also coevolve with nuclear-encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes. However, the role of positive selection on mtDNA evolution is still unclear, as most examples of intergenomic coevolution appear to be the result of compensation by nuclear-encoded genes for mildly deleterious mtDNA mutations, and not simultaneous positive selection in both genomes. Organisms that have experienced strong selective pressures to increase aerobic capacity or adapt to changes in thermal environment may be better candidates in which to examine the impact of positively selected changes on mtDNA evolution. The tuna (suborder Scombroidei, family Scombridae) and billfish (suborder Scombroidei, families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae) are highly aerobic fish with multiple specializations in muscle energetics, including a high mitochondrial content and regional endothermy. We examined the role of positively selected mtDNA substitutions in the production of these unique phenotypes. Focusing on a catalytic subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX II), we found that the rate ratio of nonsynonymous (dN; amino acid changing)-to-synonymous (d S; silent) substitutions was not increased in lineages leading to the tuna but was significantly increased in the lineage preceding the billfish. Furthermore, there are a number of individual positively selected sites that, when mapped onto the COX crystal structure, appear to interact with other COX subunits and may affect OXPHOS function and regulation in billfish. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

In order to investigate the potential association between these particular adaptations and mitochondrial aerobic energy production, we examined the camelid genes of cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, and III and the replacement of amino acids inferred. We found that all subunits had undergone a number of replacements in sites otherwise conserved in other cetartiodactyls. Changes of COXI and COXIII were mainly located in the transmembrane helices of proteins. For COXII, although most of the changes did not occur in sites directly involved in electron transfer, a shift of D by T at 115 position of Old World camelid might modify electrostatic interactions with cytochrome c. COXII also showed an increased relative evolutionary rate respect to other cetartiodactyls compared. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

Therefore, it is surprising that many of these genes in anthropoid primates (New World monkeys, Old World monkeys and apes, including humans) have been major targets of darwinian positive selection. Sequence comparisons have provided evidence that marked increases of non-synonymous substitution rates occurred in anthropoid ETC genes that encode subunits of Complex III and IV, and the electron carrier molecule cytochrome c (CYC). Two important questions are: (i) how has evolution altered ETC function? and; (ii) how might functional changes in the ETC be linked to evolution of an expanded neocortical brain?},

	abstract = {We analyzed 12 combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene datasets in seven orders of insects using both equal weights parsimony (to evaluate phylogenetic utility) and Bayesian methods (to investigate substitution patterns). For the Bayesian analyses we used relatively complex models (e.g., general time reversible models with rate variation) that allowed us to quantitatively compare relative rates among genes and codon positions, patterns of rate variation among genes, and substitution patterns within genes. Our analyses indicate that nuclear and mitochondrial genes differ in a number of important ways, some of which are correlated with phylogenetic utility. First and most obviously, nuclear genes generally evolve more slowly than mitochondrial genes (except in one case), making them better markers for deep divergences. Second, nuclear genes showed universally high values of CI and (generally) contribute more to overall tree resolution than mitochondrial genes (as measured by partitioned Bremer support). Third, nuclear genes show more homogeneous patterns of among-site rate variation (higher values of $\alpha$ than mitochondrial genes). Finally, nuclear genes show more symmetrical transformation rate matrices than mitochondrial genes. The combination of low values of $\alpha$ and highly asymmetrical transformation rate matrices may explain the overall poor performance of mitochondrial genes when compared to nuclear genes in the same analysis. Our analyses indicate that some parameters are highly correlated. For example, A/T bias was positively and significantly associated with relative rate and CI was positively and significantly associated with $\alpha$ (the shape of the gamma distribution). These results provide important insights into the substitution patterns that might characterized high quality genes for phylogenetic analysis: high values of $\alpha$, unbiased base composition, and symmetrical transformation rate matrices. We argue that insect molecular systematists should increasingly focus on nuclear rather than mitochondrial gene datasets because nuclear genes do not suffer from the same substitutional biases that characterize mitochondrial genes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence for variation in rates of nucleotide substitution among divergent taxonomic groups. Here, we summarize published rate data and show a strong relationship between substitution rate and body size. For instance, rates of nuclear and mtDNA evolution are slow in whales, intermediate in primates, and fast in rodents. A similar relationship exists for poikilothermic vertebrates. However, these taxa have slower mtDNA substitution rates overall than do homeotherms of similar size. A number of physiological and life history variables are highly correlated with body size. Of these, generation time and metabolic rate explain some patterns of rate heterogeneity equally well. In many cases, however, differences in metabolic rate explain important exceptions to the generation time model. Correlation between metabolic rate and nucleotide substitution may be mediated by (i) the mutagenic effects of oxygen radicals that are abundant by-products of aerobic respiration, and (ii) increased rates of DNA synthesis and nucleotide replacement in organisms with higher metabolic rates. Both of these factors increase mutation rate by decreasing the 'nucleotide generation time,' the average length of time before a nucleotide is copied either through replication or repair. Reconsideration of the generation time hypothesis to include physiological effects such as metabolic rate improves the theoretical underpinnings of molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {Cetaceans have most likely experienced metabolic shifts since evolutionarily diverging from their terrestrial ancestors, shifts that may be reflected in the proteins such as cytochrome b that are responsible for metabolic efficiency. However, accepted statistical methods for detecting molecular adaptation are largely biased against even moderately conservative proteins because the primary criterion involves a comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS); they do not allow for the possibility that adaptation may come in the form of very few amino acid changes. We apply the MM01 model to the possible molecular adaptation of cytochrome b among cetaceans because it does not rely on a dN/dS ratio, instead evaluating positive selection in terms of the amino acid properties that comprise protein phenotypes that selection at the molecular level may act upon. We also apply the codon-degeneracy model (CDM), which focuses on evaluating overall patterns of nucleotide substitution in terms of base exchange, codon position, and synonymy to estimate the overall effect of selection. Using these relatively new models, we characterize the molecular adaptation that has occurred in the cetacean cytochrome b protein by comparing revealed amino acid replacement patterns to those found among artiodactyls, the modern terrestrial mammals found to be most closely related to cetaceans. Our findings suggest that several regions of the cetacean cytochrome b protein have experienced molecular adaptation. Also, these adaptations are spatially associated with domain structure, protein function, and the structure and function of the cytochrome bc1 complex and its constituents. We also have found a general correlation between the results of the analytical software programs TreeSAAP (which implements the MM01 model) and CDM (which implements the codon-degeneracy model). {\textcopyright} Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2004; all rights reserved.},

However, it is not easy to account for the fact that only two mtDNA lineages (M and N) left Africa to colonize Eurasia and that lineages A, C, D, and G show a 5-fold enrichment from central Asia to Siberia. As an alternative to drift, natural selection might have enriched for certain mtDNA lineages as people migrated north into colder climates. To test this hypothesis we analyzed 104 complete mtDNA sequences from all global regions and lineages. African mtDNA variation did not significantly deviate from the standard neutral model, but European, Asian, and Siberian plus Native American variations did. Analysis of amino acid substitution mutations (nonsynonymous, Ka) versus neutral mutations (synonymous, Ks) (ka/ks) for all 13 mtDNA protein-coding genes revealed that the ATP6 gene had the highest amino acid sequence variation of any human mtDNA gene, even though ATP6 is one of the more conserved mtDNA proteins. Comparison of the ka/ks ratios for each mtDNA gene from the tropical, temperate, and arctic zones revealed that ATP6 was highly variable in the mtDNAs from the arctic zone, cytochrome b was particularly variable in the temperate zone, and cytochrome oxidase I was notably more variable in the tropics. Moreover, multiple amino acid changes found in ATP6, cytochrome b, and cytochrome oxidase I appeared to be functionally significant. From these analyses we conclude that selection may have played a role in shaping human regional mtDNA variation and that one of the selective influences was climate.},

A review of some of the knowledge of the kinetic and equilibrium behaviour of the classical cytochrome systems of mitochondria indicates that the simple redox loop concept is not adequate for building a realistic conceptual model. In particular, the remarkable behaviour of the components of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, which has long been regarded as puzzling, cannot be explained on the basis of simple redox loop formulations. However, the newly introduced concepts of the protonmotive ubiquinone cycle, or Q cycle, and of the cyclic loop 2-3 system, which represent developments of the redox loop concept, are shown to provide a promising basis for the evolution of a satisfactory theory. The mechanism of the Q cycle is discussed and developed in the light of experimental knowledge of classical mitochondrial cytochrome systems. The possible operation of a Q cycle in chloroplasts and bacteria is briefly discussed, and attention is drawn to bacterial cytochrome systems that appear to be organized as simple redox loops rather than as cyclic systems. Some aspects of notions of direct chemiosmotic coupling and indirect conformational coupling are compared in the context of research strategy. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

	abstract = {Summary Lipids play central roles in physiology and disease, where their structural, metabolic, and signaling functions often arise from interactions with proteins. Here, we describe a set of lipid-based chemical proteomic probes and their global interaction map in mammalian cells. These interactions involve hundreds of proteins from diverse functional classes and frequently occur at sites of drug action. We determine the target profiles for several drugs across the lipid-interaction proteome, revealing that its ligandable content extends far beyond traditionally defined categories of druggable proteins. In further support of this finding, we describe a selective ligand for the lipid-binding protein nucleobindin-1 (NUCB1) and show that this compound perturbs the hydrolytic and oxidative metabolism of endocannabinoids in cells. The described chemical proteomic platform thus provides an integrated path to both discover and pharmacologically characterize a wide range of proteins that participate in lipid pathways in cells.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria, semi-autonomous organelles possessing their own genetic system, are commonly accepted to descend from free-living eubacteria, namely hydrogen-producing alpha-proteobacteria. The progressive loss of genes from the primitive eubacterium to the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell is strongly justified by the Muller rachet principle, which postulates that asexual genomes, like mitochondrial ones, accumulate deleterious and sublethal mutations faster than sexual genomes, like the nucleus. According to this principle, the mitochondrial genome would be doomed to death; instead, we observe that the mitochondrial genome has a variable size and structure in the different organisms, though it contains more or less the same set of genes. This is an example of genetic conservation versus structural diversity. From an evolutionary point of view the genetic system of organelles is clearly under strong selective pressure and for its survival it needs to utilize strategies to slow down or halt the ratchet. Anyway, the mitochondrial genome changes with time, and the rate of evolution is different for both diverse regions of the mtDNA and between lineages, as demonstrated in the case of mammalian mt genomes. We report here our data on the evolution of the mitochondrial DNA in mammals which demonstrate the suitability of mtDNA as a molecular tool for evolutionary analyses. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Confronting limited oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations, and complete darkness, they epitomize a successful physiological adaptation. Here, we employ transcriptome sequencing to explore the genetic underpinnings of their adaptations to this unique habitat. Compared to Rattus norvegicus, genes belonging to GO categories related to energy metabolism (e.g. mitochondrion and fatty acid beta-oxidation) underwent accelerated evolution in the plateau zokor. Furthermore, the numbers of positively selected genes were significantly enriched in the gene categories involved in ATPase activity, blood vessel development and respiratory gaseous exchange, functional categories that are relevant to adaptation to high altitudes. Among the 787 genes with evidence of parallel evolution, and thus identified as candidate genes, several GO categories (e.g. response to hypoxia, oxygen homeostasis and erythrocyte homeostasis) are significantly enriched, are two genes, EPAS1 and AJUBA, involved in the response to hypoxia, where the parallel evolved sites are at positions that are highly conserved in sequence alignments from multiple species. Thus, accelerated evolution of GO categories, positive selection and parallel evolution at the molecular level provide evidences to parse the genetic adaptations of the plateau zokor for living in high-elevation burrows.},

	abstract = {Bat flight poses intriguing questions about how flight independently developed in mammals. Flight is among the most energy-consuming activities. Thus, we deduced that changes in energy metabolism must be a primary factor in the origin of flight in bats. The respiratory chain of the mitochondrial produces 95 of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) needed for locomotion. Because the respiratory chain has a dual genetic foundation, with genes encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we examined both genomes to gain insights into the evolution of flight within mammals. Evidence for positive selection was detected in 23.08 of the mitochondrial-encoded and 4.90 of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, but in only 2.25 of the nuclear-encoded nonrespiratory genes that function in mitochondria or 1.005 of other nuclear genes in bats. To address the caveat that the two available bat genomes are of only draft quality, we resequenced 77 OXPHOS genes from four species of bats. The analysis of the resequenced gene data are in agreement with our conclusion that a significantly higher proportion of genes involved in energy metabolism, compared with background genes, show evidence of adaptive evolution specific on the common ancestral bat lineage. Both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes display evidence of adaptive evolution along the common ancestral branch of bats, supporting our hypothesis that genes involved in energy metabolism were targets of natural selection and allowed adaptation to the huge change in energy demand that were required during the origin of flight.},

Here, we investigated the evolution of PER and CRY genes that are important for mammalian biological clocks in the subterranean rodents. We performed phylogenetic analyses using newly sequenced PER and CRY from the subterranean rodent Lasiopodomys mandarinus, the related aboveground rodent Lasiopodomys brandtii, sequences from other rodents available in public databases. The constructed phylogenetic tree revealed no convergence among subterranean rodents. Phylogenetic and selection-pressure analyses revealed the effect of purifying selection ($\omega$ < 1) on PER and CRY in subterranean rodents. Additionally, evidence of positive selection on the CRY1 and PER3 genes in several subterranean rodent species suggests adaptations to a dark habitat. Most of the positively selected sites in CRY1 and PER3 were on the C-terminus. Our findings suggest that PER and CRY are highly conserved during evolution as subterranean rodents adapted to the darkness environment, and that the C-terminal domain of CRY1 and PER3 may be the core regulatory structure of circadian rhythms. The study advances our understanding of how major circadian genes evolved in subterranean rodents.},

The phylogenetic trees of the CLOCK and BMAL1 genes were similar to the trees of the conserved Cyt b gene，further, L. mandarinus clustered with L. brandtii and Microtus ochrogaster in the phylogenetic tree. The Q-rich region of the CLOCK gene in L. mandarinus was different from that of other subterranean rodents. Using phylogenetic analysis maximum likelihood (PAML), the $\omega$ value ($\omega$ < 1) in different lineages showed that both genes have undergone purifying selection. The M8 model identified some positive selection sites in the CLOCK gene, most of which were located in the trans-transcription activation domain (TAD). In conclusion, CLOCK and BMAL1 genes did not exhibit convergent molecular evolution in subterranean rodents. Moreover, our study highlights the important functionality of the TAD, which is putatively of functional relevance to CLOCK protein activity.

Numerous morphological and physiological characters of cetaceans have been acquired in response to this drastic habitat transition, such as thickened blubber, echolocation, and ability to hold their breath for a long period of time. However, knowledge about the molecular basis underlying these adaptations is still limited. The sequence of the genome of Tursiops truncates provides an opportunity for a comparative genomic analyses to examine the molecular adaptation of this species. Here, we constructed 11,838 high-quality orthologous gene alignments culled from the dolphin and four other terrestrial mammalian genomes and screened for positive selection occurring in the dolphin lineage. In total, 368 (3.1) of the genes were identified as having undergone positive selection by the branch-site model. Functional characterization of these genes showed that they are significantly enriched in the categories of lipid transport and localization, ATPase activity, sense perception of sound, and muscle contraction, areas that are potentially related to cetacean adaptations. In contrast, we did not find a similar pattern in the cow, a closely related species. We resequenced some of the positively selected sites (PSSs), within the positively selected genes, and showed that most of our identified PSSs (50/52) could be replicated.

Here, we examined the molecular evolution of 13 protein-coding genes in the mitochondrial genome of seven caviomorph rodents, including these two subterranean genera and their above-ground relatives. Using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches, we estimated rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions. We found a significantly higher $\omega$ ratio (d. N/d. S) in subterranean groups as compared to their non-subterranean counterparts in 11 of 13 genes, although no $\omega$ ratio was larger than 1. Additionally, we applied a method based on quantitative physicochemical properties to test for positive selection. Amino acid changes implicated in radical structural or functional shifts in the protein property were found to be ubiquitous across the phylogeny, but concentrated in the subterranean lineages. Convergent changes were also found between the subterranean genera used in this study and other mammals adapted to hypoxia.

It is one of the special species of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. In their burrows, oxygen is low and carbon dioxide is high and their contents fluctuate with the change of seasons, soil types, rain and depth of burrows. However, plateau zokors show successful adaptation to that extreme environment. In this study, their adapting mechanisms to the hypoxic hypercapnic environment were analyzed through the comparison of their blood-gas properties with that of pikas (Ochotona curzniae) and Sprague-Dawley rats. The results indicated that plateau zokors had higher red blood corpuscle counts (8.11 ± 0.59 (1012/L)) and hemoglobin concentrations (147 ± 9.85 g/L), but hematocrit (45.9 ± 3.29) and mean corpuscular volume (56.67 ± 2.57 fL) were lower than the other rodents. Their arterial blood and venous blood pH were 7.46 ± 0.07 and 7.27 ± 0.07. Oxygen pressure in arterial blood of plateau zokors was about 1.5 times higher than that of pikas and rats, and it was 0.36 and 0.26 times in their venous blood. Partial pressure for carbon dioxide in arterial and venous blood of plateau zokors was 1.5-fold and 2.0-fold higher, respectively, than in rats and pikas. Oxygen saturation of plateau zokors was 5.7 and 9.3 times lower in venous blood than that of pikas and rats, respectively. As result, the difference of oxygen saturation in arterial blood to venous blood was 2- and 4.5-fold higher in plateau zokors as that of pikas and rats, respectively. In conclusion, plateau zokors had a high tolerance to pH changes in tissues, together with strong capabilities to obtain oxygen from their hypoxic-hypercapnic environment. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

	abstract = {Oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence has been used to measure the dependence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation on oxygen concentration in suspensions of isolated rat liver mitochondria. An instrument has been designed which simultaneously monitors the phosphorescence lifetime of a fluorophor and the reduction of cytochrome c by dual wavelength spectrophotometry. The phosphorescence lifetime method gives very rapid (<100 ms) measure of the oxygen concentration (Vanderkooi, J. M., Maniara, G., Green, T. J., and Wilson, D. F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5476-5482) from concentrations characteristic of air-saturated media to as low as 2 x 10-8 M. The results may be summarized as follows. For well coupled rat liver mitochondria at pH 7.0 and in the presence of ATP, as the oxygen concentration was lowered, increased cytochrome c reduction was observed to begin at oxygen concentrations greater than 20 $\mu$M. For mitochondria in the presence of uncoupler, cytochrome c reduction began at oxygen concentrations less than 1.0 $\mu$M. The oxygen dependence of reduction of cytochrome c in well coupled mitochondria treated with ATP was strongly dependent on the pH of the suspending medium. Reduction of cytochrome c began at higher oxygen concentrations as the pH was made more alkaline. The oxygen concentration for half-maximal respiratory rates was much larger for well coupled mitochondria treated with ATP (approximately 0.7 $\mu$M) than for mitochondria treated with uncoupler (less than 0.1 $\mu$M). It is concluded that the oxygen dependence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is such that mitochondria could function in their proposed role of tissue oxygen sensors for regulation of such diverse functions as local blood flow and electrical activity in the carotid body.},

The precise arrangement of SCs is largely unknown. Here, we report a 4.0-{\AA} cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the major SC in porcine heart, the 1.7-MDa SCI1III2IV1. The complex III (CIII) dimer and complex IV (CIV) bind at the same side of the L-shaped complex I (CI). Several accessory or supernumerary subunits of CI, such as NDUFA11, NDUFB4, NDUFB8, and NDUFB9, directly contribute to the oligomerization of CI, CIII, and CIV. COX7C and COX7A of CIV attach CIV to the concave surface formed by CIII and the distal end of membrane arm of CI. The structure suggests a possible mechanism by which electrons are transferred from NADH to cytochrome c and provides a platform for future functional dissection of respiration.},

We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor kB pathways that may be related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.},

A total of 121 samples (from 12 sites belonging to 3 main geographical units: U1, U2, and U3) were sequenced, from which 40 cytb haplotypes and 53 D-loop haplotypes were identified. The results of our tests from two site-specific models (M2a and M8) and one branch-site model (Clade model C) suggest that the evolution of cytb in Gansu zokor is chiefly governed by purifying selection. Moreover, the distribution of non-synonymous mutations and the tests by Clade model C indicated the cytb in U3, where the zokors were confronted with more severe hypoxia because of higher altitude and a colder, drier climate, were facing a higher purifying selection pressure than those in U1 and U2. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

	abstract = {The Tibetan grey wolf (Canis lupus chanco) occupies habitats on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a high altitude (>3000 m) environment where low oxygen tension exerts unique selection pressure on individuals to adapt to hypoxic conditions. To identify genes involved in hypoxia adaptation, we generated complete genome sequences of nine Chinese wolves from high and low altitude populations at an average coverage of 25× coverage. We found that, beginning about 55,000 years ago, the highland Tibetan grey wolf suffered a more substantial population decline than lowland wolves. Positively selected hypoxia-related genes in highland wolves are enriched in the HIF signaling pathway (P = 1.57E-6), ATP binding (P = 5.62E-5), and response to an oxygen-containing compound (P≤5.30E-4). Of these positively selected hypoxia-related genes, three genes (EPAS1, ANGPT1, and RYR2) had at least one specific fixed non-synonymous SNP in highland wolves based on the nine genome data. Our re-sequencing studies on a large panel of individuals showed a frequency difference greater than 58 between highland and lowland wolves for these specific fixed non-synonymous SNPs and a high degree of LD surrounding the three genes, which imply strong selection. Past studies have shown that EPAS1 and ANGPT1 are important in the response to hypoxic stress, and RYR2 is involved in heart function. These three genes also exhibited significant signals of natural selection in high altitude human populations, which suggest similar evolutionary constraints on natural selection in wolves and humans of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {In response to environmental changes in the Northern hemisphere, several lines of brachyodont-bunodont cricetid rodents evolved during the Late Miocene as "microtoid cricetids." Major evolutionary trends include increase in the height of cheek tooth crowns and development of prismatic molars. Derived from a possible Megacricetodon or Democricetodon ancestry, highly specialised microtoid cricetids first appeared with Microtocricetus in the Early Vallesian (MN 9) of Eurasia. Because of the morphological diversity and degree of parallelism, phylogenetic relationships are difficult to detect. The Trilophomyinae, a more aberrant cricetid side branch, apparently became extinct without descendants. Two branches of microtoid cricetids can be recognized that evolved into "true" arvicolids: (1) Pannonicola (= Ischymomys) from the Late Vallesian (MN 10) to Middle Turolian (MN 12) of Eurasia most probably gave rise to the ondatrine lineage (Dolomys and Propliomys) and possibly to Dicrostonyx, whereas (2) Microtodon known from the Late Turolian (MN 13) and Early Ruscinian (MN 14) of Eurasia and possibly parts of North America evolved through Promimomys and Mimomys eventually to Microtus, Arvicola and other genera. The Ruscinian genus Tobienia is presumably the root of Lemmini. Under this hypothesis, in contrast to earlier views, two evolutionary sources of arvicolids would be taken into consideration. The ancestors of Pannonicola and Microtodon remain unknown, but the forerunner of Microtodon must have had a brachyodont-lophodont tooth crown pattern similar to that of Rotundomys bressanus from the Late Vallesian (MN 10) of Western Europe. Possibly, Pannonicola and Microtodon share a common ancestor. The fossil record suggests that an important center of origin for arvicolids was located in northeast Asia. From this region arvicolids could have dispersed to Europe and North America and vice versa during the late Cenozoic at various times. {\textcopyright} Society of Vertebrate Paleontology November 2011.},

	abstract = {A test for coadaptation of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes was performed using the sibling species, Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. Two lines of flies with "disrupted" cytonuclear genotypes were constructed by repeated backcrossing of males from one species to females carrying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the other species. Each "disrupted" strain was competed in population cages with the original stock of each species from which the recurrent males were obtained during the backcrossing. As such, the two species&#039; mitochondrial types were competed reciprocally in the nuclear genetic environments of each species. The trajectories of mtDNA haplotypes were followed in discrete-generation population cages using a PCR-four-cutter approach. A significant increase in the frequency of D. pseudoobscura mtDNA was observed in each of four replicate cages with a D. pseudoobscura nuclear background. In the D. persimilis nuclear background, one cage actually showed an increase in frequency of D. pseudoobscura mtDNA, although together the four replicate cages show little change in frequency. These results were repeated after frequency perturbations and reinitiation of each cage. An analysis of fitness components revealed that fertility selection greatly outweighed viability selection in these cytonuclear competition experiments. The asymmetry of the fitnesses of the mtDNA haplotypes on the two genetic backgrounds is consistent in direction with the previously reported asymmetry of female fertility in backcrosses between these two species. While our experiments do not allow us to identify mtDNA as the sole source of fitness variation, at a minimum the data indicate a fitness association between nuclear fertility factors and the D. pseudoobscura mtDNA on its own genetic background.},

With the large amount of genetic variation in this system, the potential power to detect intraspecific fitness differences in fly lines that carry distinct haplotypes is great. We test three life-history traits on fly lines with known sequence differences in the mtDNA genome after controlling the nuclear genome by backcrossing. We find that flies with the siI haplotype are fastest developing and have the lowest probability of surviving to three experimental periods (2–6, 12–17, and 34–39 days of age). Wild-type males with siIII mtDNA were more active while disruption of specific coadapted nucleo-mitochondrial complexes caused a significant decrease in activity. These results are discussed in the context of the geographic distribution of each haplotype.},

	abstract = {Tests were performed of the selective neutrality of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants from geographic populations of Drosophila melanogaster in Argentina (ARG) and Central Africa (CAF). The two populations were completely reproductively compatible. The two distinct mtDNA haplotypes from the two populations were competed in replicate experimental populations on three nuclear genetic backgrounds: homozygous ARG, homozygous CAF, or hybrid ARG/CAF. Mitochondrial haplotype frequencies did not change significantly on either of the two homozygous nuclear backgrounds, and there was no change after experimental perturbation of haplotype frequencies. On the hybrid background, the ARG haplotype frequency increased significantly for the first two generations in all replicate populations but then did not change in subsequent generations. After perturbation, the ARG haplotype frequency increased in only one of four replicates. There is no evidence for selective differences among mtDNA variants in homozygous nuclear contexts or for nuclear-mitochondrial coadaptation. While some "fitness" difference among mtDNA variants is required to account for the observed frequency shifts, it appears that in these hybrid populations, mtDNA is hitchhiking on fitness variation among hybrid segregating nuclear genes. These results have implications for the use of mtDNA in the study of hybrid zones and gene flow.},

This genus includes three subgenera Alticola s.str., Aschizomys and Platycranius, and belongs to the tribe Clethrionomyini comprising also red-backed voles Clethrionomys and oriental voles Eothenomys. In order to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within Alticola and to examine its position within the tribe, mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene variation was estimated, and the results were compared with morphological and palaeontological data. Maximum likelihood (ML), neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses show that the genus Alticola does not appear to be a monophyletic group since the representatives of Aschizomys branch within Clethrionomys, whereas two other subgenera (Alticola and Platycranius) form a separate monophyletic clade. Flat-headed vole Alticola (Platycranius) strelzowi is nested within the nominative subgenus showing close association with A. (Alticola) semicanus. Surprisingly, the two species of Aschizomys do not form a monophyletic group. The results of the relaxed-clock analysis suggest that the Alticola clade splits from the Clethrionomys stem in early Middle Pliocene while basal cladogenetic events within Alticola s.str. dates back to the late Middle to early Late Pliocene. A scenario of evolution in Clethrionomyini is put forward implying rapid parallel morphological changes in different lineages leading to the formation of Alticola-like biomorphs adapted to mountain and arid petrophilous habitats. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

A study focusing on the genetic variation in Ellobius from Mongolia was conducted using one mitochondrial and three nuclear markers. Two divergent allopatric lineages endemic to East Central Asia were revealed. The first lineage occurs from Dzungaria eastwards to central Mongolia and represents E. tancrei sensu stricto. The second lineage is found in East Gobi only and corresponds to a taxon described as Ellobius orientalis, which has been traditionally treated as a subspecies of E. tancrei. However, molecular and chromosome data indicate that orientalis is related not to E. tancrei but to E. talpinus, which is separated from the former by a distribution gap of $\sim$2,000 km. The taxonomic status of the East Gobi mole vole is ambiguous, and its genetic distance from E. talpinus s. str. falls into the range characteristic for closely related vole species or semi-species. According to molecular estimates, the two taxa have been isolated since the late Middle Pleistocene. A similar divergence is observed between the East and West Central Asian lineages of E. tancrei. E. alaicus is placed as sister to the latter rendering E. tancrei sensu lato paraphyletic. The revealed phylogeographic pattern implies that East Central Asia was colonized by mole voles through multiple eastward dispersal events.},

	abstract = {In absolute terms, flight is a highly energetically expensive form of locomotion. However, with respect to its cost per unit distance covered, powered flight is a very efficient mode of transport. Birds and bats are the only extant vertebrate taxa that have achieved flight. Phylogenetically different, they independently accomplished this elite mode of locomotion by employing diverse adaptive schemes and strategies. Integration of functional and structural parameters, a transaction that resulted in certain trade-offs and compromises, was used to overcome exacting constraints. Unique morphological, physiological and biochemical properties were initiated and refined to enhance the uptake, transfer and utilization of oxygen for high aerobic capacities. In bats, exquisite pulmonary structural parameters were combined with optimal haematological ones: a thin blood-gas barrier, a large pulmonary capillary blood volume and a remarkably extensive alveolar surface area in certain species developed in a remarkably large lung. These factors were augmented by, for example, exceptionally high venous haematocrits and haemoglobin concentrations. In birds, a particularly large respiratory surface area and a remarkably thin blood-gas (tissue) barrier developed in a small, rigid lung; a highly efficient cross-current system was fabricated within the parabronchi. The development of flight in only four animal taxa (among all the animal groups that have ever evolved; i.e. insects, the now-extinct pterosaurs, birds and bats) provides evidence for the enormous biophysical and energetic constraints that have stymied volancy. Bats improved a fundamentally mammalian lung to procure the large amounts of oxygen needed for flight. The lung/air sac system of birds is not therefore a prescriptive morphology for flight: the essence of its design can be found in the evolution of the reptilian lung, the immediate progenitor stock from which birds arose. The attainment of flight is a classic paradigm of the remarkable adaptability inherent in organismal and organic biology for countering selective pressures by initiating elegant morphologies and physiologies.},

	abstract = {We compared and statistically evaluated the effectiveness of nine DNA extraction procedures by using frozen and dried samples of two silt loam soils and a silt loam wetland sediment with different organic matter contents. The effects of different chemical extractants (sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], chloroform, phenol, Chelex 100, and guanadinium isothiocyanate), different physical disruption methods (bead mill homogenization and freeze-thaw lysis), and lysozyme digestion were evaluated based on the yield and molecular size of the recovered DNA. Pairwise comparisons of the nine extraction procedures revealed that bead mill homogenization with SDS combined with either chloroform or phenol optimized both the amount of DNA extracted and the molecular size of the DNA (maximum size, 16 to 20 kb). Neither lysozyme digestion before SDS treatment nor guanidine isothiocyanate treatment nor addition of Chelex 100 resin improved the DNA yields. Bead mill homogenization in a lysis mixture containing chloroform, SDS, NaCl, and phosphate-Tris buffer (pH 8) was found to be the best physical lysis technique when DNA yield and cell lysis efficiency were used as criteria. The bead mill homogenization conditions were also optimized for speed and duration with two different homogenizers. Recovery of high-molecular-weight DNA was greatest when we used lower speeds and shorter times (30 to 120 s). We evaluated four different DNA purification methods (silica-based DNA binding, agarose gel electrophoresis, ammonium acetate precipitation, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration) for DNA recovery and removal of PCR inhibitors from crude extracts. Sephadex G-200 spin column purification was found to be the best method for removing PCR-inhibiting substances while minimizing DNA loss during purification. Our results indicate that for these types of samples, optimum DNA recovery requires brief, low-speed bead mill homogenization in the presence of a phosphate-buffered SDS-chloroform mixture, followed by Sephadex G-200 column purification.},

The 'positive-selection model' assumes an additional category of positively selected sites at which nonsynonymous substitutions occur at a higher rate than synonymous ones. This model is also used to identify target sites for positive selection. The models are applied to a data set of the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope gene, sequenced at different years after the infection of one patient. The results provide strong support for variable selection intensity among amino acid sites. The neutral model is rejected in favor of the positive-selection model, indicating the operation of positive selection in the region. Positively selected sites are found in both the V3 region and the flanking regions.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that selection cannot maintain a joint nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphism within a population except under restrictive conditions of frequency-dependent or sex-specific selection. These conclusions are based on fitness interactions between a diploid autosomal locus and a haploid cytoplasmic locus. We develop a model of joint transmission of X chromosomes and cytoplasms and through simulation show that nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphisms can be maintained by selection on X-cytoplasm interactions. We test aspects of the model with a “diallel” experiment analyzing fitness interactions between pairwise combinations of X chromosomes and cytoplasms from wild strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Contrary to earlier autosomal studies, significant fitness interactions between X chromosomes and cytoplasms are detected among strains from within populations. The experiment further demonstrates significant sex-by-genotype interactions for mtDNA haplotype, cytoplasms, and X chromosomes. These interactions are sexually antagonistic—i.e., the “good” cytoplasms in females are “bad” in males—analogous to crossing reaction norms. The presence or absence of Wolbachia did not alter the significance of the fitness effects involving X chromosomes and cytoplasms but tended to reduce the significance of mtDNA fitness effects. The negative fitness correlations between the sexes demonstrated in our empirical study are consistent with the conditions that maintain cytoplasmic polymorphism in simulations. Our results suggest that fitness interactions with the sex chromosomes may account for some proportion of cytoplasmic variation in natural populations. Sexually antagonistic selection or reciprocally matched fitness effects of nuclear-cytoplasmic genotypes may be important components of cytonuclear fitness variation and have implications for mitochondrial disease phenotypes that differ between the sexes.},

A total of 43 different nucleotides exist in the displacement-loop (D-loop) region of mtDNA between B6 and RR. Heteroplasmic embryos were reconstructed by electrofusion using a blastomere from a two-cell stage embryo of one strain and an enucleated blastomere from a two-cell stage embryo of the other strain. Equivalent volumes of both types of mtDNAs were detected in blastocyst stage embryos. However, the mtDNA from the RR strain became biased in the progeny, regardless of the source of the nuclear genome. The RR mtDNA population was very high in most of the tissues examined but was relatively low in the brain and the heart. An age-related increase of RR mtDNA was also observed in the blood. The RR mtDNAs in the reconstructed embryos and in the embryos collected from heteroplasmic mice showed a different segregation pattern during early embryonic development. These results suggest that the RR mtDNA has a replicative advantage over B6 mtDNA during embryonic development and differentiation, regardless of the type of nuclear genome.},

A total of 121 samples (from 12 sites belonging to 3 main geographical units: U1, U2, and U3) were sequenced, from which 40 cytb haplotypes and 53 D-loop haplotypes were identified. The results of our tests from two site-specific models (M2a and M8) and one branch-site model (Clade model C) suggest that the evolution of cytb in Gansu zokor is chiefly governed by purifying selection. Moreover, the distribution of non-synonymous mutations and the tests by Clade model C indicated the cytb in U3, where the zokors were confronted with more severe hypoxia because of higher altitude and a colder, drier climate, were facing a higher purifying selection pressure than those in U1 and U2. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

@article{Tavares2018,
	abstract = {Several rodent lineages independently acquired the ability to dig complex networks of tunnels where fossorial and subterranean species spend part or their whole life, respectively. Their underground lifestyles imposed harsh physiological demands, presumably triggering strong selective pressures on genes involved in energy metabolism like those coding for mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, underground lifestyles must have increased inbreeding and susceptibility to population bottlenecks as well as restricted migration, leading to small effective population size (N e) that, in turn, must have reduced the effectiveness of selection. These stringent environmental conditions and small N e might be still operating as antagonist factors of selection efficacy in these rodents. In this report, we tested, in a phylogenetic framework, how the intensity of selection on protein-coding mitochondrial genes (mt-genes) fluctuated along the evolution of fossorial and subterranean rodents respective to aboveground lineages. Our findings showed significant selection relaxation in most mt-genes of subterranean hystricomorphs (African mole-rats, tuco-tucos, and coruro), while only in three mt-genes of fossorial hystricomorphs (degus, red vizcacha rat, and fossorial spiny rats) selection efficacy was strongly reduced, probably due to demographic constraints. Conversely, selection intensification was found to have occurred in three mt-genes in fossorial sciuromorphs (ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmot, and allies). Our findings indicated that evolution of mitogenomes in fossorial and, mainly, in subterranean rodents was a complex output of a balance between intense ecological and physiological pressures, together with demographic constraints leading to genetic drift that, in turn, might have resulted in relaxed selection in hystricomorphs.},

@article{Zhou2015,
	abstract = {Phenotypic convergence is thought to be driven by parallel substitutions coupled with natural selection at the sequence level. Multiple independent evolutionary transitions of mammals to an aquatic environment offer an opportunity to test this thesis. Here, whole genome alignment of coding sequences identified widespread parallel amino acid substitutions in marine mammals; however, the majority of these changes were not unique to these animals. Conversely, we report that candidate aquatic adaptation genes, identified by signatures of likelihood convergence and/or elevated ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate, are characterized by very few parallel substitutions and exhibit distinct sequence changes in each group. Moreover, no significant positive correlation was found between likelihood convergence and positive selection in all three marine lineages. These results suggest that convergence in protein coding genes associated with aquatic lifestyle is mainly characterized by independent substitutions and relaxed negative selection. It has been suggested that convergent evolution is characterized by convergent or parallel amino acid substitutions at specific amino acid sites in distant organisms 1,2. For example, more than half of the substitutions (62 of 126 experimental substitutions) in two replicate populations of bacteriophage $\phi$ X174 were parallel, and approximately 94 of candidate convergently evolved genes in a study of distant echo-locating mammals (toothed whales and echolocating bats) contained parallel amino acid substitutions 3,4. Given that these conclusions are typically drawn from experiments with animals and/or analyses of pairs of organisms that independently acquired a trait of interest 3-6 and may be subject to strong artificial selection and random substitutions, it is of interest to examine the molecular basis for convergent adaptations in three or more independent natural groups. One such opportunity is offered by the phenotypic convergence following the transition of mammals from terrestrial to aquatic environments, which occurred at least three times independently 7. Extant marine mammals include more than 120 species belonging to three distinct mammalian orders: Carnivora (walruses, sea lions, and other pinnipeds), Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), and Sirenia (manatees and dugongs). Cetaceans and sirenians originated approximately 50 million years ago in the early Eocene, while pinnipeds trace their ancestry back to late Oligocene 8. Because of similar constraints imposed by an aquatic environment, marine mammals are characterized by obvious morphological convergence, such as a streamlined body shape with modified limbs (pinnipeds have front and hind limbs modified as flippers, whereas cetaceans and sirenians completely lost their hind limbs). In addition, most marine mammals present a respiratory system adapted for reduced oxygen consumption, which enables them to withstand hypoxia and prolong deep dives 8. Despite a rich history of the field, specifically},

	abstract = {Convergent evolution has been demonstrated across all levels of biological organization, from parallel nucleotide substitutions to convergent evolution of complex phenotypes, but whether instances of convergence are the result of selection repeatedly finding the same optimal solution to a recurring problem or are the product of mutational biases remains unsettled. We generated 20 replicate lineages allowed to fix a single mutation from each of four bacteriophage genotypes under identical selective regimes to test for parallel changes within and across genotypes at the levels of mutational effect distributions and gene, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide changes. All four genotypes shared a distribution of beneficial mutational effects best approximated by a distribution with a finite upper bound. Parallel adaptation was high at the protein, gene, amino acid, and nucleotide levels, both within and among phage genotypes, with the most common first-step mutation in each background fixing on an average in 7 of 20 replicates and half of the substitutions in two of the four genotypes occurring at shared sites. Remarkably, the mutation of largest beneficial effect that fixed for each genotype was never the most common, as would be expected if parallelism were driven by selection. In fact, the mutation of smallest benefit for each genotype fixed in a total of 7 of 80 lineages, equally as often as the mutation of largest benefit, leading us to conclude that adaptation was largely mutation-driven, such that mutational biases led to frequent parallel fixation of mutations of suboptimal effect.},

@article{Kuo2015,
	abstract = {Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit B (RRM2B) is a stress response protein that protects normal human fibroblasts from oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanism that governs this function is not entirely understood. To identify factors that interact with RRM2B and mediate anti-oxidation function, large-scale purification of human Flag-tagged RRM2B complexes was performed. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 and 2 (PYCR1, PYCR2) were identified by mass spectrometry analysis as components of RRM2B complexes. Silencing of both PYCR1 and PYCR2 by expressing short hairpin RNAs induced defects in cell proliferation, partial fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress in hTERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-hTERT). Moderate overexpression of RRM2B, comparable to stress-induced level, protected cells from oxidative stress. Silencing of both PYCR1 and PYCR2 completely abolished anti-oxidation activity of RRM2B, demonstrating a functional collaboration of these metabolic enzymes in response to oxidative stress. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyzes conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphate (NDP) to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate (dNDP), a rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of deoxyribunucleotide (dNTP). Hence, RR activity is crucial for maintaining cellular levels of dNTPs, which are used for DNA synthesis during DNA replication and DNA repair. Mammalian RR holoenzyme consists of two large subunits, RRM1, and two small subunits, RRM2 or RRM2B. In most cell types, expression of RRM1 is constant throughout all phases of cell cycle, whereas RRM2 expression is low in G1 phase 1,2 , induced during G1/S transition, and degraded in G 2 /M 3 and in G 1 4 phase of the next cell cycle. RRM2B, also known as p53R2, was first identified as a p53-response gene 5,6. Although both RRM2 and RRM2B are highly homologous, regulation of RRM2B is distinct from that of RRM2. Basal expression of RRM2B is low under unstressed condition, but is profoundly induced by stress such as DNA damage or oxidative stress 5-7. Consistent with the modes of regulation, RRM1/RRM2 complex controls progression from G 1 to S phase, whereas RRM1/RRM2B complex regulates DNA repair 8-10. Although it is well characterized that RRM2B is involved in the process of DNA repair, mutations of RRM2B have been identified in patients with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, suggesting that RRM2B is an essential gene for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA 11-15. RRM2B is expressed at low level independent of p53 activation and without expression of RRM2 in non-proliferating cells, RRM1/RRM2B complex is the only remaining RR holoenzyme that maintains dNTP pools to supply for mitochondrial DNA synthesis as well as},
